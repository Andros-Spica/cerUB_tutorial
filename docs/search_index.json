This document shows how to use cerUB protocols to explore petrographic and compositional data. As an example, we provide the ‘amphorae’ dataset concerning wine Roman amphorae from sites in Catalonia, NE Spain. It is a live version of the Appendix C of an article published in Journal of Archaeological Science (see reference below). Installing cerUB Initial procedures Protocol 1 - Geochemical data Protocol 2 - Petrographic data Protocol 3 - Geochemical and petrographic data Protocol 4 - Provenance data Protocol 4 - Provenance data with shipwrecks Appendix: Interpreting biplots All rmarkdown (.Rmd) source files are available in the repository. There, the publication appendices folder contains alternative versions of the appendices (supplementary materials) of the related article: Angourakis, A., Martínez Ferreras, V., Torrano A., Gurt Esparraguera, J.M.
