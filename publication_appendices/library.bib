abstract = {The book is intended as an introduction to the ‘classical' methods of multivariate analysis that have been widely used in archaeometric data analysis for the last 40 years or so. The main methods covered are principal component, cluster and linear discriminant analysis, as well as exploratory methods that can be used before these are applied. The emphasis is on the ideas that underpin these methods, their implementation, and interpretation. Some of the relevant mathematics is included for completeness, but the intention is that the book can be read without needing to understand the mathematical detail provided. The intended readership is archaeological scientists, presumed to have some knowledge of basic statistics but not any great experience of multivariate analysis.},

@article{Turner2004a,
abstract = {Conflicts associated with natural resource use are common in rural areas of Africa. Political ecology's analytical and methodological foci on these conflicts is shared by other quite different schools of thought that strongly influence policies on environment and development. The influential “environmental security” and “common property management” perspectives generally conceptualize resource-related conflicts as scarcity-driven while political ecologists have made major contributions toward more multidimensional, complex views about the genesis of resource-related conflict. This paper explores two moral dimensions of resource conflict. First, it continues the tradition within political ecology of questioning popular notions of resource conflict. It does so by analyzing farmer–herder conflict in the Sahel—a type of resource-related conflict that seemingly fits the view that conflict is generated from increased competition over a dwindling pool of resources. By seriously engaging with the materiality of agropastoral production, this paper illuminates the complex relationships between political interests, moralities, and resource access that underlie these conflicts. Second, this paper considers the ethics of how we portray resource conflict. In the present policy context in Africa, overly-simplistic treatments of resource conflict by political ecologists or others may unintentionally support programs that are likely to negatively impact the human subjects of research, conservation or development.},

abstract = {Provides an overall view of, and original insights into, the economics of land and resources in the Roman world; * Features a range of different methodologies and theoretical perspectives; * Relevant to the economic history of medieval and early modern Europe, and therefore appeals to a wide scholarly audience of historians and economists. Explanation of the success and failure of the Roman economy is one of the most important problems in economic history. As an economic system capable of sustaining high production and consumption levels, it was unparalleled until the early modern period. This volume focuses on how the institutional structure of the Roman Empire affected economic performance both positively and negatively. An international range of contributors offers a variety of approaches that together enhance our understanding of how different ownership rights and various modes of organization and exploitation facilitated or prevented the use of land and natural resources in the production process. Relying on a large array of resources - literary, legal, epigraphic, papyrological, numismatic, and archaeological - chapters address key questions regarding the foundations of the Roman Empire's economic system. Questions of growth, concentration and legal status of property (private, public, or imperial), the role of the state, content and limitations of rights of ownership, water rights and management, exploitation of indigenous populations, and many more receive new and original analyses that make this book a significant step forward to understanding what made the economic achievements of the Roman empire possible. Readership: Scholars and students interested in the ancient Roman economy and the institutional structure of the Roman Empire, in particular the role played by land and resources, as well as classical studies, economic history, and classical archaeology.},

abstract = {Questions: Are ordinal data appropriately treated by multivariate methods in numerical ecology? If not, what are the most common mistakes? Which dissimilarity coefficients, ordination and classification methods are best suited to ordinal data? Should we worry about such problems at all? Methods: A new classification model family, OrdClAn (Ordinal Cluster Analysis), is suggested for hierarchical and nonhierarchical classifications from ordinal ecological data, e.g. the abundance/dominance scores that are commonly recorded in relev{\'{e}}s. During the clustering process, the objects are grouped so as to minimize a measure calculated from the ranks of withincluster and between-cluster distances or dissimilarities. Results and Conclusions: Evaluation of the various steps of exploratory data analysis of ordinal ecological data shows that consistency of methodology throughout the study is of primary importance. In an optimal situation, each methodological step is order invariant. This property ensures that the results are independent of changes not affecting ordinal relationships, and guarantees that no illusory precision is introduced into the analysis. However, the multivariate procedures that are most commonly applied in numerical ecology do not satisfy these requirements and are therefore not recommended. For example, it is inappropriate to analyse Braun-Blanquet abudance/dominance data by methods assuming that Euclidean distance is meaningful. The solution of all problems is that the dissimilarity coefficient should be compatible with ordinal variables and the subsequent ordination or clustering method should consider only the rank order of dissimilarities. A range of artificial data sets exemplifying different subtypes of ordinal variables, e.g. indicator values or species scores from relev{\'{e}}s, illustrate the advocated approach. Detailed analyses of an actual phytosociological data set demonstrate the classification by OrdClAn of relev{\'{e}}s and species and the subsequent tabular rearrangement, in a numerical study remaining within the ordinal domain from the first step to the last.},

abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs), perhaps used along with other methods, are increasingly being applied to address problems involving social-ecological systems (SES). However, systematic and standardized techniques for organizing data requirements and collecting information for such models are generally not applied. Defining the types of data that need to be collected is a critical step in instantiating relevant models and detailing behavioral patterns. By organizing data needs into pertinent categories, researchers can focus efforts to make data collection more efficient, provide a clear record of gathered data, conserve project resources, and create models more easily. In this paper, we present a formal method, which we call Delineate, Structure, and Gather (DSG), that has been applied to guide the determination of data requirements, structure data needs, and enable data collection for the development of ABMs addressing SES. The presented framework continues and supplements existing efforts that provide standardization and protocol techniques for constructing ABMs. An active project is presented in order to demonstrate how DSG can be implemented to address SES issues.},

abstract = {Evidence from archaeological excavation, intensive surface survey, geoarchaeological investigations, and remote sensing conducted in fall 2002 establishes parameters for the long-term history of human-environment interaction on the eastern margins of the Upper Khuzestan plains. During the 6th-4th millennia ВСЕ (the Susiana and Protoliterate periods), human settlement in this region was dispersed, intermittent, and shifting, due in part to a subsistence economy based on opportunistic floodwater farming and small-scale sheep and goat herding. Dense settled occupation of the region began only in the later 2nd millennium ВСЕ (during the Middle Elamite period), though little is yet known about land use practices at this time. By the early 1st millennium CE, large-scale canal irrigation is already well developed on the plains and has significantly altered their morphology. Observations along the modern Gargar River reveal its origin as an artificial canal, confirming the testimony of 10th century geographers. Archaeological and historical evidence supports reconstruction of the function and history of this channel and assessment of its effects on the agricultural potential of its catchment and on the accumulation and preservation of archaeological deposits.},

abstract = {The author's His first aim is intention to fill in this thesis is twofold. a major lacuna in Middle Eastern ethnography by documenting with as much precision as possible the economics of tribal nomadic sheep and goat rearing an entire annual pastoral cycle. His second objective in the light of this economic description, to analyze the political structure of a tribal society in which nomadic pastoralism still plays an important role. Both themes are treated with specific reference to materials gathered during prolonged fieldwork among the tribes of Luristan, western Iran. After a brief excursion into recent Luri history to illustrate the genesis of the present situation, the author isolates the ecological and cultural constraints impinging in the late 1960s upon the behaviour patterns of different categories of Luri tribesmen and ranks these social categories according to the degree and type of members' involvement in the exploitation of various combinations of pastoral capital. He observes that the categories fall into two distinct groups. These may be said to constitute two separate social strata, between which there is little either upward or downward mobility. Using a model of social process originally developed by Prof. Fredrik Barth but here modified and employed in conjunction with certain tenets of systems theory to give it accrued flexibility, the author shows how the upper stratum enforces its absolute political hegemony over the lower by the exertion of monopolistic control over access to vital resources in a variety of spheres. In a concluding chapter attention is paid to far-reaching changes wrought in Luri tribal society since the late-1960s. These are explained as predictable ongoing variations in the overall scheme of Luri social organization generated by a series of major shifts in the external parameters of the model of process presented earlier.},

abstract = {Developments in the statistical analysis of compositional data over the last two decades have made possible a much deeper exploration of the nature of variability and the possible processes associated with compositional data sets from many disciplines. In this paper, we concentrate on geochemical data. First, we explain how hypotheses of compositional variability may be formulated within the natural sample space, the unit simplex, including useful hypotheses of sub-compositional discrimination and specific perturbational change. Then we develop through standard methodology, such as generalised likelihood ratio tests, statistical tools to allow the systematic investigation of a lattice of such hypotheses. Some of these tests are simple adaptations of existing multivariate tests but others require special construction.We comment on the use of graphical methods in compositional data analysis and on the ordination of specimens. The recent development of the concept of compositional processes is then explained, together with the necessary tools for a staying-in-the-simplex approach, such as the singular value decomposition of a compositional data set. All these statistical techniques are illustrated for a substantial compositional data set, consisting of 209 major oxide and trace element compositions of metamorphosed limestones from the Grampian Highlands of Scotland. Finally, we discuss some unresolved problems in the statistical analysis of compositional processes.},

abstract = {The introduction of new technologies into small remote communities can alter how individuals acquire knowledge about their surrounding environment. This is especially true when technologies that satisfy basic needs, such as freshwater use, create a distance (i.e., diminishing exposure) between individuals and their environment. However, such distancing can potentially be countered by the transfer of local knowledge between community members and from one generation to the next. The objective of this study is to simulate by way of agent-based modeling the tensions between technology-induced distancing and local knowledge that are exerted on community vulnerability to climate change. A model is developed that simulates how a collection of individual perceptions about changes to climatic-related variables manifest into community perceptions, how perceptions are influenced by the movement away from traditional resource use, and how the transmission of knowledge mitigates the potentially adverse effects of technology-induced distancing. The model is implemented utilizing climate and social data for two remote communities located on the Seward Peninsula in western Alaska. The agent-based model simulates a set of scenarios that depict different ways in which these communities may potentially engage with their natural resources, utilize knowledge transfer, and develop perceptions of how the local climate is different from previous years. A loosely-coupled pan-arctic climate model simulates changes monthly changes to climatic variables. The discrepancy between the perceptions derived from the agent-based model and the projections simulated by the climate model represent community vulnerability. The results demonstrate how demographics, the communication of knowledge and the types of 'knowledge-providers' influence community perception about changes to their local climate.},

A strong correlation existed between the difnculty the hawk had capturing individuals of each species and the difference between the proportions of substandard individuals in the hawk's diet and the prey populations. The degree to which substandard individuals of a particular prey species are taken disproportionately by a predator seems to be a direct function of how difficult it normally is for the predator to capture and kill individuals of that species.

abstract = {In 2002, the unexpected discovery of Hellenistic architectural blocks, buried in 8 m of alluvium, found displaced in a former bed of the river of Balkh, brought about a programme of surveys and excavations under the aegis of the French Archaeological Mission in Bactria. The geoarchaeological side of the programme focused on the drawing of a regional geomorphological map then on the identification, mapping and dating of the palaeochannels of the river of Balkh. We established the chronology of several fluvial channel generations by association with archaeological settlements of different eras (Bronze Age, Bactro-Achaemenid period, Kushan period, Islamic period) and with optically stimulated luminescence dating carried out on alluvium deposits. The present riverbed leading up to Aqcha was formed during the Islamic period. We suspect the primary agent of this change in the river channel to, be tectonic activity and the activation of a blind fault crossing the floodplain. We identified a northern Bactro-Achaemenid aqueduct, currently located in the desert area separating the plain of Balkh from the Amu Darya. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many metapopulation models assume rules of population connectivity that are implicity based on what we know about within-population dispersal, but especially for vertebrates, few data exist to assess whether interpopulation dispersal is just within-population dispersal "scaled up." We extended existing multi-stratum mark-release-recapture models to incorporate the robust design, allowing us to compare patterns of within- and between-population movement in the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis). Movement was rare among eight populations separated by only a few hundred meters: seven years of twice-annual sampling captured {\textgreater} 1200 individuals but only 26 interpopu- lation dispersers. We developed a program that implemented models with parameters for capture, survival, and interpopulation movement probability and that evaluated competing hypotheses in a model selection framework. We evaluated variants of the island, stepping- isolation-by-distance models, or models combining the effects of isolation by distance and habitat. Models with probability of dispersal expressed as linear-logistic functions of dis- tance and as negative exponentials of distance fit the data equally well. Interpopulation movement probabilities were similar among sexes (perhaps slightly biased toward females), stone, and isolation-by-distance models of interpopulation movement, incorporating effects of age, season, and habitat (short or tall grass). For both sexes, QAIC, values clearly favored greater for juveniles than adults (especially for females), and greater before than during the breeding season (especially for females). These patterns resemble those previously described for within-population dispersal in this species, which we interpret as indicating that the same processes initiate both within- and between-population dispersal.},

abstract = {The genesis of agriculture is one of the recurring themes of Chinese archaeology. However, while questions about the origins of domesticated plants and animals and the date of their domestication have received much recent attention, anthropologically oriented research on early sedentary communities is a less developed field. This paper contributes to such research by focusing on the structure of early sedentary communities in northeast China and addressing such issues as their economic adaptation, the internal organization of households, economic activities and sharing strategies of household members, and mechanisms of community integration. Analysis of data from the Zhaobaogou site, the only early Neolithic site from northeast China for which a comprehensive excavation report was published, suggests that households were relatively independent production and consumption units with little sharing and exchange among households. The integration of the community was probably associated with non-economic activity such as religious rituals. Comparison of the patterns observed in the Zhaobaogou data with patterns from contemporaneous sites in the Wei River area highlights differences in the social organization of the early sedentary communities in the two areas. Those differences are meaningful for our understanding of the different socio-political trajectories of the two areas and may serve for cross-cultural comparisons with other parts of the world. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

They describe the current systems based mainly on rangeland, sedentary small holders mixed farming, and the more recent sedentary intensive system. Most of these systems are located in low rainfall areas of the WANA region and are facing dramatic feed shortage and drought management risks. Feed calendar witnesses of the importance of barley grain as a supplement feed for small ruminants and the relative failure of cropAivestock integration in most of the countries. Rangeland contribution to small ruminant feed requirements is decreasing and barley cultivation is invading the best rangelands, and steppe zones. Therefore, desertification, loss of soil and natural resources is of first concern for the region. Stubble plays a key in filling the summer feeding gap. Crop residues from cereals and olive tree are playing a more and more important role in almost all the countries. The current systems may be improved through the implementation of some technologies such as (i) the promotion of alternative feed resources; (i¡) the fallow replacement with adapted (native) legumes; (iii) the promotion of on-farm shrubs planting and their integration with cereal crops production (alley-cropping). Some examples of complementarity between conventional feeds and shrubs are discussed and illustrate the real potential of such integration.},

abstract = {Correspondence Analysis (CA) is a popular tool for archaeological data analysis, ap- propriate for use with tables of non-negative number. The technique allows the visual display of the associations between the rows and between the columns of a data matrix, and the relationships between them. Archaeologists with this kind of data often have no problem in understanding the ideas behind CA, but with limited training in statistics may have problems in implementing it. Commercial, menu driven, statistical software packages of the type used for service teaching in universities are expensive and restrictive in the way results from a CA can be presented. Archaeologists outside the university sector may not have access to such software. This paper is a guide to how the open-source software R can be used to undertake CA. R is a sophisticated, “state-of-the-art” package that is constantly updated. It is not menu driven and can seem forbidding to new users. The paper provides a detailed account, ranging from installation of the package through to real applications of CA, that has helped, and we hope will continue to help, encourage the use of CA among archaeologists who have previously been discouraged from engaging with it.},

abstract = {Between the 13th and 11th centuries BCE, most Greek Bronze Age Palatial centers were destroyed and/or abandoned. The following centuries were typified by low population levels. Data from oxygen-isotope speleothems, stable carbon isotopes, alkenone-derived sea surface temperatures, and changes in warm-species dinocysts and formanifera in the Mediterranean indicate that the Early Iron Age was more arid than the preceding Bronze Age. A sharp increase in Northern Hemisphere temperatures preceded the collapse of Palatial centers, a sharp decrease occurred during their abandonment. Mediterranean Sea surface temperatures cooled rapidly during the Late Bronze Age, limiting freshwater flux into the atmosphere and thus reducing precipitation over land. These climatic changes could have affected Palatial centers that were dependent upon high levels of agricultural productivity. Declines in agricultural production would have made higher-density populations in Palatial centers unsustainable. The 'Greek Dark Ages' that followed occurred during prolonged arid conditions that lasted until the Roman Warm Period. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Their task was complicated by the institutional and ideological legacy of the Soviet system as well as by a more actively engaged international community. These nascent states inherited a set of institutions that included bloated bureaucracies, centralized economic planning, and patronage networks. Some of these institutions survived, others have mutated, and new institutions have been created. Experts on Central Asia here examine the emerging relationship between state actors and social forces in the region. Through the prism of local institutions, the authors reassess both our understanding of Central Asia and of the state-building process more broadly. They scrutinize a wide array of institutional actors, ranging from regional governments and neighborhood committees to transnational and non-governmental organizations.

abstract = {Seed production was studied in Bauhinia ungulata, a neotropical, perennial legume. Our goals were to identify the biotic factors influencing seed output, the magnitude and variability of their effects, and whether these effects were density dependent. We measured predispersal repro- ductive success in five stands, ranging in size from 18 to 175 ramets. Pollination success and flower herbivory were evaluated for 1375 flowers. Other sources decreasing seed output were observed by examining 1714 seedpods. Six factors led to reduction in potential seed-set. In order of the magnitude of their effects, these factors were lack of pollination, incomplete development of ovules in flowers that formed seedpods, herbivores that damaged flowers that could have been pollinated, bruchids that destroyed developing seeds, herbivores that damaged pistils, and herbivores that ate developing pods. Density dependence was observed for three of the factors: level of pollination success, seed predation, and herbivory on developing seedpods. There was significant variation among stands for the six factors that were measured in all stands. Key factor analysis was used to estimate the influence of these factors on variation among stands in seed-set. Seed predators and pollinators accounted for most of the observed variation. We conclude that pollinators and predators on seeds are potentially important to the population dynamics of this plant.},

@unpublished{Blench2001a,
abstract = {Pastoralism, the use of extensive grazing in rangelands for livestock production, is one of the key production systems in the world's drylands. Nonetheless, throughout much of its long history its reputation has been unflattering, its practitioners marginalised by sedentary cultivators and urban dwellers. Pastoral societies have risen and fallen, fragmented into isolated families or constructed world-spanning empires and their demise regularly announced, often in the face of entirely contrary evidence of their persistence. By some paradox, anthropologists and social theorists have conducted a prolonged love affair with pastoralism, at times seeing it as an inevitable stage in the growth of civilization or perversely caricaturing it as an anarchic institution ready to pull down that same civilization. Planners have denigrated the mobility characteristic of pastoral societies and novelists have romanticised the wanderings of these same nomads. Development experts, remarking the enormous passing herds, first saw pastoral systems as rich in potential, and later castigated pastoralists as vulnerable and unable to invest in development. To all this, pastoralists have remained largely indifferent, since a certain scepticism towards the schemes and caprices of the external world is an almost inevitable product of the independent image they have of themselves. The late twentieth century has seen a new upwelling of writing on pastoralism, both sentimental and aggrieved, regretting its inevitable demise and blaming pastoralists for their failure to respond to the vagaries of climate and the international economic system. Investment in pastoral development, which reached a high point in the 1970s, crumbles progressively every year. At the same time, however, pastoralists themselves have become far more articulate and able to communicate their concerns and desires to the outer world. The collapse of the Soviet Empire has opened up the great steppes of Central Asia for the first time in seventy years making accessible a whole world of pastoralism that had been essentially closed to researchers since 1919. Indeed, the likely effect has been to expand pastoralism, as refugees from now collapsed industrial enterprises that only functioned with significant subsidy have sought to revive the only method of subsistence that is practical through much of this region. The time seems apposite then, for a view of pastoralism in the world as a whole, combining recent insights from archaeology and anthropology with twentieth century experiences of development. Despite a plethora of case studies, monographs and collected papers on African and Asian pastoral systems, integrated worldwide overviews of pastoralism are surprisingly few. The most recent essay in this direction is probably Khazanov (1984) which approaches pastoralism from a historical point of view, focusing on nomad relations with external societies and the origin of the state. The rich and complex literature on pastoral development is effectively ignored, perhaps unsurprisingly from the point of view of Soviet ethnography. More important, however, is the failure to integrate the biological, to recognise that pastoral society is above all driven by the nature and requirements of different species. This monograph is intended to try and provide a synopsis of the present and draw out the implications for the future.},

Social models are contradicted by the ethnographic record and beg as many questions as they address, and adaptive models are hampered by a faulty understanding of evolutionary processes and contradicted by the fact that the ostensible “benefits” of sedentism are not true benefits at all. This article explores the concept of population pressure, often naively used in the past, and relates it to evolutionary processes. It proposes that in certain contexts increased sedentism is both innovatively generated by population pressure and independently selected for by it. It further proposes that the primary advantage to increased sedentism is ensured access to the most productive portions of a territory in the context of increasing competition. Thus increased sedentism will tend to develop whenever the energetics of the situation favor the abandonment of less productive or difficult‐to‐defend portions of an existing territory—when the risks and costs of defending the status quo come to exceed the risks and costs of exploiting a smaller territory more intensively.},

Multivariate analysis is most problematic when ordinal variables appear together with other scale types in the data. This difficulty is solved by extending Gower's general coefficient of similarity to ordinal data types, facilitating cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. Two alternatives, a non-metric and a metric version, are offered. The modified formula implies that ordinal variables are equally weighted with the others, and that partially and fully ranked data are both applicable, due to the inherent standardisation procedure. A morphological data set derived for the moss genus Tortula illustrates the new approach.},

@phdthesis{Becerra2007,
abstract = {In this thesis we explore the use of domain information incorporated dur- ing the execution of an evolutionary algorithm, through the use of a cul- tural algorithm. The cultural algorithms are evolutionary algorithms that support an additional mechanism for information extraction during the execution of the algorithm, avoiding the need to encode the information a priori. Firstly, a cultural algorithm to tackle constrained optimization prob- lems was developed. Such algorithm adopts differential evolution as its model for the population. Using the differential evolution operators as a base, we designed four knowledge sources, each one with a particular in- fluence over the operators. Since each knowledge source exhibits different benefits in different phases of the search, a main mechanism to control the application rate of the operators was developed, based on the success rate each one. This algorithm was tested using a well-known benchmark and a pair of instances of engineering optimization problems, and compared with other representative algorithms of the state-of-the-art. In both cases, equal or better solutions were obtained, requiring a smaller number of objective function evaluations. In the next phase, a hybrid algorithm to tackle multiobjective optimiza- tion problems was developed. Such algorithm is a hybrid between the previous algorithm for constrained optimization, and a method of math- ematical programming called $\epsilon$-constraint. We obtained other advantages with this algorithm, like obtaining good approaches of the Pareto front in problems that have been very difficult to solve for other evolutionary approaches. As a last contribution, we introduced an approach to perform incorporation of preferences to the previous algorithm, but such approach can also be used in an wide set of techniques. This proposal is based on the use of vectors of goals. With the addition this approach, is possible to re- duce the computational cost needed when applying the hybrid algorithm on problems with a large number of objectives, turning it applicable on practice.},

abstract = {A recent switch in the study of the beginning of agriculture is to demonstrate the increasingly closer interaction between people and the landscape and how this would have played a crucial role in the transition to agriculture. Understanding the palaeo-ecology of the local environments at key sites and its relationship with subsistence strategies is critical to an improved appreciation of such interactions. This article examines macro- and micro-plant remains discovered at two important sites in North China, both dated to around 10,000 cal. yr BP. These two sites, Zhuannian and Nanzhuangtou, are located on the terrace of the Bai River in the Yan Mountains and next to Baiyangdian Lake on the piedmont of the Taihang Mountains, respectively. The floral remains at these two sites provide a great opportunity to examine (1) post-Pleistocene subsistence strategies, (2) the increasing consumption of millets and grassy plants and its significance and (3) the intra-regional diversity in food exploitation and its relationships with local environments. While the macro-plant remains at Nanzhuangtou indicate the importance of aquatic plants in the palaeo-diet, those at Zhuannian suggest a tendency of exploiting tree plants. This significance of these diversified plant food exploitation strategies by the last hunter-gatherers should be paid more attention in future research. Our data also once again confirm the importance of millet consumption to these hunter-gatherers on the eve of millet domestication.},

The Spring Palace (the Qarshi-"Suri" of Juvaini, the Gegenchaghan of Rashid al-Din and the Jiajianchahan-dian of Saolin-cheng of the Yuan shi) is located at the site known as Doityn Balgas, and the Winter Palace (the Ong-khin of the Rashid al-Din) I consider to be at the Shaazan-khot site. The sites of the Summer and Autumn Palaces are uncertain at this point. Judging from the location of the Spring and Winter Palaces, it is clear that the emperors moved over a distance of 450 km each year and a reconstruction of the migration route shows that the emperor had a domain of 14,000 square km.

@article{Alizadeh2014a,
abstract = {The landscapes of the Sasanian Empire have been studied in detail and have been remarkably well interpreted during past few decades. Recent research in borderland areas has also increased our knowledge of Sasanian policies in borderlands. The Sasanian Empire is well known for massive construction work. Projects such as construction of fortifications and defensive walls, irrigation systems, fortified towns and cities in the Sasanian period usually are attributed to the reigns of Kawad I and his son Husraw I Anushirwan in the sixth century. This attribution mostly derives from historical documents in which Husraw is seen as primarily responsible for these massive projects. Recent archaeological re- searches in the Gorgān plain in the northeast of Iran and in Mughan Steppe in Iranian Azerbaijan have demonstrated the possibility of dating these projects earlier in the fifth century. This is significant because it may shed more light on the socio-political dynamics of the Sasanian Empire. Focusing on the Caucasus, especially on data acquired from the Mughan Steppe projects, I will try to place this new data and information in its socio-political context and reconsider earlier notions on borderlands of the Sasanian Empire. Regardless of insecurity in borderlands, the Sasanian Empire heavily invested in these areas. In this article, reviewing historical documents and archaeological data, I will argue that the imperial investments in the borderland areas represent a multi-purpose plan.},

abstract = {Any interpretation of archaeological animal bone assemblages benefits greatly from a knowledge of animal behaviour patterns and population dynamics, but there are difficulties in directly imposing modern data onto past, often non-analogue environments, and in assuming species-specific behaviour. This paper suggests that behavioural ecology – which stresses adaptation – provides a fruitful approach for predicting ethological details of past wild animal populations. The study focuses on the genus Gazella, whose remains are commonly found on archaeological sites in south-west Asia in the period 20,000–7500 before present (BP), and whose role in human societies has been much debated. Following a behavioural ecological method, selected data from 18 modern observed gazelle populations are summarized, compared, and the factors that influence and constrain the animals' behaviour are discussed. The potential for using the principles of behavioural ecology to predict factors such as gazelle social structure, reproductive strategies and mobility patterns in past environments is considered, and the value of such an approach for zooarchaeological interpretation is demonstrated.},

For multivariate outlier detection methods this implies that not the given data but appropriately transformed data need to be used. We use the isometric logratio (ilr) transformation, which seems to be generally the most proper one for theoretical and practical reasons. In this space it is difficult to interpret the outliers, because the reason for outlyingness can be complex. Therefore we introduce tools that support the interpretation of outliers by representing multivariate information in biplots, maps, and univariate scatterplots.},

Chemical compositional data, as used in provenance studies on archaeological materials, will be approached from the measurement theory. The results will show, in a very intuitive way that chemical data can only be treated by using the approach developed for compositional data. It will be shown that compositional data analysis is a particular case in projective geometry, when the projective coordinates are in the positive orthant, and they have the properties of logarithmic interval metrics. Moreover, it will be shown that this approach can be extended to a very large number of applications, including shape analysis. This will be exemplified with a case study in architecture of Early Christian churches dated back to the 5th-7th centuries AD},

abstract = {The epic plains and arid deserts of Central Asia have witnessed some of the greatest migrations, as well as many of the most transformative developments, in the history of civilization. Christoph Baumer's ambitious four-volume treatment of the region charts the 3000-year drama of Scythians and Sarmatians; Soviets and transcontinental Silk Roads; trade routes and the transmission of ideas across the steppes; and the breathless and brutal conquests of Alexander the Great and Chinghiz Khan. Masterfully interweaving the stories of individuals and peoples, the author's engaging prose is richly augmented throughout by colour photographs taken on his own travels. For all the complexity of the history, Dr Baumer, a noted authority on Central Asia, never loses sight of the sweeping grandeur of its overall setting. Volume 1 focuses on the geography of the area now occupied by present-day Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, northern Afghanistan, western and central Mongolia and parts of southern Russia and northern China. Discussing the changing climates of the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Ages, the author explores subjects as diverse as glacial retreat; the invention of the wheel; the legendary Cimmerians and Amazons; Hellenism and Zoroastrianism; and the Oxus Treasure. Future volumes will explore the later historical periods of the region.},

Here we argue that understanding the basis of food mixing (i.e., eating different food types) and food selection behavior is central to understanding the causes and con- sequences of omnivory. Despite the existence of several alternative hypotheses, constraints imposed by nutrients are often assumed to explain the function of food mixing by omnivores and herbivores. However, few studies have actually addressed this issue through rigorous tests of multiple hypotheses. To illustrate the importance of non-nutritive factors, we marshal evidence for the roles of toxin dilution, parasite avoidance and resistance, and predation risk in food mixing and food selection by omnivores and polyphagous herbivores. Whether food mixing stabilizes population, community, and food web dynamics is likely to depend on the details of food selection and the spatial and temporal scales of food mixing.},

In the light of these debates this chapter examines the evolution of pastoral land tenure and user rights in each of the five republics over the 20 years since independence. Different choices were made by policy makers that have affected two key outcomes: firstly, livestock mobility and secondly, pasture access. The situation in each of the republics is reviewed and some case studies are presented.},

@phdthesis{Macopiyo2005b,
abstract = {An agent based-model of mobility of pastoralists was developed and applied to the semi-arid rangeland region extending from southern Ethiopia to northern Kenya. This model was used to investigate temporal adaptation of pastoralists to the spatial heterogeneity of their environment. This dissertation describes the development, structure, and corroboration process of the simulation model, Pastoral Livestock Movement Model (PLMMO). PLMMO is a spatially explicit, individual-based pastoralists-animal foraging and movement model. It simultaneously simulates the foraging and movement behavior of individual pastoralists and their livestock in a rangeland ecosystem. Pastoralists' herd mobility patterns and other measures of movement were compared to data from field studies. Predictions of the model correspond to observed mobility patterns across seasons. The distances moved were found to be significantly correlated (r2 = 0.927 to 0.977, p{\textless}0.0001) to drought and non-drought climatic regimes. The PLMMO model therefore proved to be a useful tool for simulating general movement patterns of pastoralists relative to movement range sizes in the pastoral rangelands of southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. We then used the PLMMO model to explore the impact of emerging changes in rangeland use in the study area. The ways in which pastoralists' mobility patterns adapt to emerging challenges in the study area were explored by simulating the following four scenarios: 1) climate change with concomitant reduction in forage yield, 2) climate change with concomitant improvement and higher variability in forage yield, 3) increased livestock population densities and 4) improved access to water. The climate induced change scenario with increased and more variable forage production resulted in the shortest distances moved by pastoralists in comparison to all other scenarios. The total search distances under this scenario were only 20{\%} of normal season distances. The improved water access scenario also returned a significant (p=0.017) drop in distances moved. There was, however, no significant impact on either increase in livestock numbers or reduction in available forage on mobility. We judged the agent-based model PLMMO developed here as a robust system for emulating pastoral mobility in the rangelands of eastern Africa and for exploring the consequences of climate change and adaptive management scenarios.},

As analytical techniques, Neutron Activation Analysis and X-Ray Diffraction have been used. Both approaches lead to substantially different results. This shows that they detect different levels of alteration and should complement each other rather than being used exclusively. For the special process of a glassy phase decomposition followed by a crystallization of the Na-zeolite analcime, the results suggest that it changes high-fired calcareous pottery rapidly, and so fundamentally that the results of various archaeometric techniques can be severely disturbed.},

The model is a stylised abstraction of the Yamana society, which inhabited the channels and islands of the southernmost part of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina-Chile). According to ethnographic sources, the Yamana developed cooperative behaviour supported by an indirect reciprocity mechanism: whenever someone found an extraordinary confluence of resources, such as a beached whale, they would use smoke signals to announce their find, bringing people together to share food and exchange different types of social capital. The model provides insight on how the spatial concentration of beachings and agents' movements in the space can influence cooperation. We conclude that the emergence of informal and dynamic communities that operate as a vigilance network preserves cooperation and makes defection very costly.},

abstract = {A consistent access to food is paramount for humans at individual and group level. Besides providing the basic nutritional needs, access to food defines social structures and has stimulated innovation in food procurement, processing and storage. We focus on the social aspects of food storage, namely the role of cooperation for the emergence and maintenance of common stocks. Cooperative food stocks are examined here as a type of common-pool resource, where appropriators must cooperate to avoid shortage (i.e. the tragedy of commons). ‘Food for all' is an agent-based model in which agents face the social dilemma of whether or not to store in a cooperative stock, adapting their strategies through a simple reinforcement learning mechanism. The model provides insights on the evolution of cooperation in terms of storage efficiency and considering the presence of social norms that regulate reciprocity. For cooperative food storage to emerge and be maintained, a significant dependency on the stored food an...},

The development of livestock husbandry appears to coincide with the advent of a drier Middle Holocene climatic, followed by a relatively fast expansion all over West Africa. Pastoral–nomadic strategies developed in the northern Saharan part are hardly distinguishable from Late Stone Age settlement–subsis- tence traditions, while genuine agro-pastoral systems emerged in the south, along the Sahara–Sahel margins. In all the cases, stone tumuli burials, rock art stations, and intermittent or permanent settlements were used as de facto territorial markers, effective signposts of West African Collector, herder, and peasant territoriality.},

abstract = {Archaeological investigations of pastoral economies often emphasize exchange relations with agricultural populations, though for Bronze Age Eurasia the notion of a ubiquitous ‘pastoral realm' has masked various forms of mixed subsistence economies. In Central Asia, there are few attempts to specifically identify the domestic crops utilized by mobile pastoralists or what they may suggest about the role of agriculture in mobile pastoral production or subsistence strategies. This study reports the macrobotanical remains from two Late/Final Bronze Age (ca. 1950–1300 bc) mobile pastoralist habitation sites in the Murghab alluvial fan region of southern Turkmenistan. We compare our results with published macrobotanical data from contemporary agricultural settlements in the Murghab region, as well as with other sites in broader prehistoric Eurasia. We find that mobile pastoralists in the Murghab utilized some of the same domestic crops as their sedentary neighbors. While the data presented here do not preclude the possibility that mobile pastoralists may have practiced some low-investment cultivation (particularly of millet), we hypothesize an economic model that places mobile pastoralists in direct contact with nearby sedentary farming communities through exchange for pre-processed grains. These results highlight one of the possible strategies of mobile pastoral subsistence in Central Asia, and are a further step toward identifying the various degrees of agricultural involvement in the conceptually outdated pastoral realm of Eurasia.},

abstract = {Beta diversity can be defined as the variability in species composition among sampling units for a given area. We propose that it can be measured as the average dissimilarity from individual observation units to their group centroid in multivariate space, using an appropriate dissimilarity measure. Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used. We propose a new dissimilarity measure which allows the relative weight placed on changes in composition vs. abundance to be specified explicitly.},

When modeling societies, where experimentation is not practical or ethical, validation of models is inherently difficult. However, one of the significant strengths of the Agent- Based Modeling (ABM) approach is that the approach begins with the implementation of a theory of behavior for relatively low-level agents and then produces high-level behaviors emerging from the low-level theory's implementation. Our ABM model of societies is based on modeling the decision making of rural households in a 1,600 km (1,000 mile) square around Lake Victoria in East Africa. We report on the first validation our model of households making their living on a daily basis by comparing resulting activities against societal data collected by anthropologists.},

abstract = {Central Asia is a wide subject of research in the archaeological and historical studies of the Ancient World. Scholars have usually focused on the complex and diverse questions that resulted from the analysis of the historical realities of this key region during Antiquity. The purpose of this book is to undertake an approach to the polymorphic and multiple aspects of Central Asia in Antiquity from several points of view. The starting point is the confidence in an interdisciplinary perspective as the main way to understand the different aspects of the region in a very wide chronology: from the emergence of the cities and their relation with the nomadic populations, to the expansion of models and practices from Central Asia to the West during the campaigns and conquests led by Islam. Through subjects like warfare, gender studies and historiography, mainly from an archaeological point of view, the chapters analyze concrete sites like Mes Aynak, Uch Kulakh or Vardanzeh, but also models of interaction among the historical peoples living in Asia Central, like the Bactrians and the Persians, the Persians and Macedonians, the Greeks and the Indians, the Sassanid and the Romans, or even the Sassanid and the Steppe peoples. The result is a very clear example of the richness of starting an interdisciplinary dialogue with the intention of improving our perspectives and understandings of the complex relationships that, through Antiquity, the people living in Central Asia had developed and how scholars can, through archaeology and other related disciplines, approach the historical questions that arise in a close study of the subjects.},

Nomadic movement is highly purposeful and is oriented toward achieving specific production or other goals. Commonly nomadic mobility is used to advance production goals in a number of diverse sectors. However, nomadism is not tied to one type of economic system; some nomads have generalized, consumption-oriented production, while others are specialized and market-oriented. Nor is nomadism limited to one type of land tenure; some nomads migrate within a territory that they control, while others have no political or legal claim over the land they use. Furthermore, some pastoral nomads live in isolated regions far from other populations, while others live close to peasant and urban populations. Pastoral nomads vary in political structure from state-controlled peasants, to centralized chiefdoms, to weak chiefdoms, to segmentary lineages systems.},

Building upon such efforts, a new object-oriented simulation framework is being developed for ancient Mesopotamia that can assemble and execute highly complex simulation scenarios. This framework can be used to investigate socioecological interactions over a broad range of social, spatial, and temporal scales, allowing for a wide range of past socioecological issues to be concurrently addressed. Such capabilities are enabled by simulation tools that are flexible, scalable, and highly expressive. Perhaps the greatest promise of these tools for studying the past is their potential for enabling scholars to gain new insights by testing various theoretical hypotheses and perspectives in social-natural systems in a rich socioecological simulation context.},

abstract = {In dryland Africa, development attention has shifted toward community resource management projects. The concurrence of environmental degradation, resource conflict, and "weak" resource management institutions is seen by project managers as evidence for the failure of local institutions to govern resource use. This article demonstrates that such diagnoses are error prone and are often logically reducible to the simple advocation of the formalization of resource access. "Community based" projects, such as those following the Gestion de Terroirs approach in Sudano - Sahelian West Africa, often attempt to improve resource management by spatially delimiting appropriate land uses, strengthening the community's exclusionary powers, and clarifying specific claims to village resources. Based on research within agropastoral areas in Mali and Niger, this article argues that rigid adherence to such development templates runs the risk of increasing local ecological and economic vulnerabilities.

abstract = {Functional diversity is at the heart of current research in the field of conservation biology. Most of the indices that measure diversity depend on variables that have various statistical types (e.g. circular, fuzzy, ordinal) and that go through a matrix of distances among species. We show how to compute such distances from a generalization of Gower's distance, which is dedicated to the treatment of mixed data. We prove Gower's distance can be extended to include new types of data. The impact of this generalization is illustrated on a real data set containing 80 plant species and 13 various traits. Gower's distance allows an efficient treatment of missing data and the inclusion of variable weights. An evaluation of the real contribution of each variable to the mixed distance is proposed. We conclude that such a generalized index will be crucial for analyzing functional diversity at small and large scales.},

abstract = {Abstract The accommodation of livestock husbandry with crop agriculture is crucial for the future of the West African Sahel. Present trends are leading to greater restrictions on livestock husbandry and a growing convergence of livelihood practices among groups whose identities are tied to herding and farming. Using the cases of four rural communities in Niger, this study adopts an ‘access to resources' framework to analyse the causal connections among: rural peoples' livelihood strategies, everyday social relations of production, perceptions of social groups' identities, and the potential for farmer–herder conflict. While the convergence of livelihoods arguably increases the frequency of conflict triggers, it has also, through the expansion of shared common interests and cross-group, production-related relationships, improved the ability of communities to effectively manage these incipient conflicts.},

We reconstruct the hitherto unrecorded economy of high mountain pastoralists who lived at the site from the mid-3rd to early 1st millennium B.C. We argue that within the broad dynamics of mountain pastoralism there is local variability as shown through multi-season residence, farming, and craft production. In bringing together multiple data sets to address how the site was used we 1) show that ceramics were locally produced with similar manufacture technology across eight centuries - which breaks significantly from the canonical cultural history and large-scale migration paradigms that have defined the regional archaeology for decades; 2) identify a new tradition of cremation ritual (3rd millennium B.C.), and; 3) present the earliest evidence (3rd millennium B.C.) for the local use of domesticated grains and then farming (2nd millennium B.C.) in northern Central Asia. We provide a unique case study to bear on debates concerning the relationship between long-term regional stability and technological innovations among early central Eurasian pastoralists.},

The merits of different approaches are investigated empirically in the paper, using 20 published data sets showing different degrees of structure. The opportunity is taken to examine the merits of the rarely used rank transformation, which has potential attractions when outliers occur or the variables are unusually distributed.},

A first proposal uses the k-nearest neighbor procedure based on the Aitchison distance, a distance measure especially designed for compositional data. It is important to adjust the estimated missing values to the overall size of the compositional parts of the neighbors. As a second proposal an iterative model-based imputation technique is introduced which initially starts from the result of the proposed k-nearest neighbor procedure. The method is based on iterative regressions, thereby accounting for the whole multivariate data information. The regressions have to be performed in a transformed space, and depending on the data quality classical or robust regression techniques can be employed. The proposed methods are tested on a real and on simulated data sets. The results show that the proposed methods outperform standard imputation methods. In the presence of outliers, the model-based method with robust regressions is preferable.},

abstract = {Pastoral systems may be envisaged as a product of a number of interacting variables: the characteristics of the animals, the environment, and of the human culture. Animal physiological and behavioural characteristics affect their suitability to different climatic, topographical and ecological environments. This paper attempts to advance our understanding of the environmental factors constraining animal husbandry on the prehistoric Eurasian steppe, an area that exhibits a broad range of environmental conditions, through comparisons of data on archaeological animal bone assemblages and historic and modern herd compositions (specifically the proportions of cattle, sheep/goats and horse). There are strong biases towards different taxa dependent on region. The consistencies between the later prehistoric animal bone data and the modern and historic livestock herd compositions indicate the constraining role of the environment on the pastoral economies practiced across the Eurasian steppe, in that pastoral strategies appear to be focussing on species best adapted to regional environments. Other patterns may be indicative of socioeconomic trends, such as the relatively low proportions of horse herded in modern times. The results indicate variability in herd compositions across the study area being influenced in part by regional climatic, topographical and ecological conditions. Thus, it is suggested, that part of the variability seen in herd compositions is environmentally determined, with herders making decisions based on the animals' biological and behavioural characteristics. Better understanding of the environmental constraints on pastoral economies will enable us to address a range of questions relating to past pastoralists, and allow us to better assess the cultural factors at play.},

abstract = {Social and environmental factors affecting land use change are among the most significant drivers transforming the planet. Such change has been and continues to be monitored through the use of satellite imagery, aerial photography, and technical reports. While these monitoring tools are useful in observing the empirical results of land use change and issues of sustainability, the data they provide are often not useful in capturing the fundamental policies, social drivers, and unseen factors that shape how landscapes are transformed. In addition, some monitoring approaches can be prohibitively expensive and too slow in providing useful data at a timescale in which data are needed. This paper argues that techniques using information fusion and conducting assessments of continuous data feeds can be beneficial for monitoring primary social and ecological mechanisms affecting how geographic settings are changed over different time scales. We present a computational approach that couples open source tools in order to conduct an analysis of text data, helping to determine relevant events and trends. To demonstrate the approach, we discuss a case study that integrates varied newspapers from two Midwest states in the United States, Iowa and Nebraska, showing how potentially significant issues and events can be captured. Although the approach we present is useful for monitoring current web-based data streams, we argue that such a method should ultimately be integrated closely with less managed systems and modeling techniques to enhance not only land use monitoring but also to better forecast and understand landscape change.},

Archaeometric research provides inforrnation on production technology, useful for a wider comprehension on these productions. Besides, it also provides compositional inforrnation. However, archaeometric research can not provide knowledge on which the composition of pottery from Eivissa as a unit is, on the contrary it provides inforrnation on a plurality of productions within Eivissa. Moreover, this plurality will serve to assign provenance to production units at an infra island level. Therefore, archaeometric research will allow an important enrichment in our knowledge of social and economical interrelations that pottery reflects.

abstract = {Some of the most politically and culturally significant cities in first millennium BC northern Mesopotamia were located in agriculturally marginal landscapes. In order to sustain these settlements, variant cultivation techniques were practiced by local populations. Understanding the dynamics and implications of crop management practices requires that socio-ecological variables be addressed over recurrent crop cycles. This paper employs a coupled socio-ecological modeling approach that enables interactions between a quantitative environmental model and an agent-based social model by using the ENKIMDU simulation tool. The reconstructed landscape near the ancient city of Assur is used as the example setting to test the effectiveness of simulated cultivation strategies. These methods include sole dependence on biennial fallow and rainfall, gravity flow irrigation, application of manure, and the integration of all these approaches. Results obtained within ENKIMDU attempt to delineate agricultural constraints and potential benefits of the specific anthropogenic processes and strategies addressed. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

@article{Rosen2000a,
abstract = {A detailed geoarchaeological and environmental study of southeastern Kazakhstan reveals subtle changes of land use and environment during the Iron Age. Major economic changes from pastoralism to agriculture over time may be reinterpreted from these new findings. With the archaeological, environmental and agricultural information we can suggest a scenario for Saka-Wusun settlement and economy. In the Early Iron Age, Saka tribes moved into the area from the north (Yablonski 1995b) at a time corresponding to a cool-moist Subboreal period. The first settlers at Tuzusai has an agro-pastoral economy in which animals were grazed at least part of the year on the panicoid steppe grasses to the north of Tuzusai, and agriculture was characterized by a dominance of millet. Due to a short growth period, millet is favoured by semi-sedentary pastoralists because the crop can be planted and harvested while maintaining a semi-sedimentary seasonal round. This is especially significant given the short length of the summer growing season and increase in frost-days during the Subboreal period. Millet would have been better adapted to this environmental regime than wheat. In the vicinity of Tuzusai the early Iron Age landscape was an actively aggrading alluvial fan. The alluvial silt originating from the outwash of extended alpine glaciers would have provided a rich agricultural environment with high water tables, aggrading streams, and fresh silts deposited in moist fields each spring. The middle and later phases of occupation at Tuzusai coincided with the onset of the warmer Subatlantic period. The agricultural growing season would have been longer than that of the preceding Subboreal phase. There was a cessation of alluviation on the fan, a stability in the landscape and the beginning of soil formation as indicated by Soil 2. Historically, it was an interval in which Wusun peoples increased their presence in the region due to political and economic pressure from newly consolidating tribes of the Xiongnu to the east and alliances with the Yueh Chih to the west (Enoki et al. 1994; Zadneprovskiy 1994: Ishjamts 1994). There were elite segments which commanded large armies (Ishjamts 1994) and it follows that they would find it necessary to have some measure of control over agricultural production and surplus. The emergence of complex nomadic confederacies might have provided the 'push' factor leading to the intensification of the agricultural sector at the same time that environmental amelioration offered a 'pull' factor. The phytolith remains from Tuzusai appear to represent a small but significant shift from a more pastoral orientation to a more intensive agricultural focus, aided by both environmental and historical factors.},

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic study of the relation between the size of irrigation systems and the management of uncertainty. We specifically focus on studying, through a stylized theoretical model, how stochasticity in water availability and taxation interacts with the stochastic behavior of the population within irrigation systems. Our results indicate the existence of two key population thresholds for the sustainability of any irrigation system: or the critical population size required to keep the irrigation system operative, and N* or the population threshold at which the incentive to work inside the irrigation system equals the incentives to work elsewhere. Crossing irretrievably leads to system collapse. N* is the population level with a sub-optimal per capita payoff towards which irrigation systems tend to gravitate. When subjected to strong stochasticity in water availability or taxation, irrigation systems might suffer sharp population drops and irreversibly disintegrate into a system collapse, via a mechanism we dub 'collapse trap'. Our conceptual study establishes the basis for further work aiming at appraising the dynamics between size and stochasticity in irrigation systems, whose understanding is key for devising mitigation and adaptation measures to ensure their sustainability in the face of increasing and inevitable uncertainty.},

Using the method for raw data or for improperly transformed data will, however, lead to biased results and consequently to misleading interpretations. Although some procedures, suitable for factor analysis with compositional data, were already developed, they require pre-knowledge of variable groups, or are complicated to handle. We present an approach based on the centred logratio (clr) transformation that does not build on this pre-knowledge, but still recognizes the specific character of compositional data. In addition, by using the isometric logratio transformation it is possible to robustify factor analysis using a robust estimation of the covariance matrix. A back-transformation of the results to the clr space allows an interpretation of the results with compositional biplots. The method is demonstrated with data from the Kola project, a large ecogeochemical mapping project in northern Europe.},

Like discriminant analysis, the goal of DCA is to categorize observations in pre-defined groups, and like correspondence analysis, it is used with nominal variables. The main idea behind DCA is to represent each group by the sum of its observations and to perform a simple CA on the groups by variables matrix. The original observations are then projected as supplementary elements and each observation is assigned to the closest group. The comparison between the a priori and the a posteriori classifications can be used to assess the quality of the discrimination. A similar procedure can be used to assign new observations to categories. The stability of the analysis can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as jackknifing or bootstrapping.},

This paper aims to explore different coding systems and statistical analyses for grouping ceramic thin sections.

The group separation is compared between methods and with previous non-automatic grouping of the same material.

abstract = {Although the majority of people in semi-Arid Africa sustain themselves primarily by growing crops, this means of production is not practiced by all, nor is it the sole means practiced by the majority. Because of inadequate rainfall and high evaporation rates, average crop yields are low, and the risk of crop failure is high. Traditionally the inhabitants of these regions have relied on domestic grazing animals to supplement their food supply. The ultimate degree of this dependence is embodied in pure pastoralism; however, semi-Arid Africa has a wide range of variation, both in the nature and the degree of economic dependency on livestock.},

abstract = {The Negev is an arid desert, where the natural conditions do not allow for subsis- tence on agriculture. Nevertheless, remnants of ancient agriculture, particularly a tre- mendous network of terraced wadis, are scattered over an area exceeding 3000 km2. According to recent studies, the well-preserved remains of agricultural systems point to two waves of settlement. One wave was in the Byzantine period (fifth to seventh cen- tury C.E.), when settlements were dispersed along a strip extending 50 km south of the Beer Sheva Valley. The second wave, in the Umayyad period (seventh to eighth century C.E.), extended about 30 km beyond the Byzantine settlement. The expansion of agri- culture in the midst of the wilderness can be attributed to two developments. One was imperial policy during the Byzantine and Umayyad periods, which encouraged agri- cultural settlements on the frontier. The other was an anticipated process known to occur among seminomads living on the margins of permanent settlements. In this pro- cess, the seminomads gradually shifted from nomadism to spontaneous settlements, which culminated in sedentarization by the state.},

@book{Barfield1981b,
abstract = {The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 focused international attention on this country for the first time in nearly a century. The need for reliable information has only become been greater. Because of their traditional xenophobia toward the West, successive Afghan governments have restricted the number of scholars permitted to undertake extensive fieldwork. For this reason Thomas Barfield's study of the Central Asian Arabs of Afghanistan is a welcome addition to the literature, a literature which is not likely to grow in the coming years as war, domestic unrest and restrictive travel policies continue to make the research environment in Afghanistan unfavorable. The Central Asian Arabs are a little-known people of northeastern Afghanistan. This book is an account of the changes that have taken place in their way of life over the twentieth century as they switched from a form of subsistence pastoralism to a cash economy. Barfield's research constitutes a substantial revision of the standard hypothesis on the economic and social status of nomadic pastoralists, as originally posited by Fredrik Barth. One of Barfield's main purposes is to provide a case study that illustrates the wide-ranging complexity of pastoral nomadism, its integration into a regional economy, and how structural changes have occurred within the pastoral economy itself.},

@article{Schmitt1996,
abstract = {Mechanisms underlying competitive effects between two species of marine snails (Tegula aureotincta and Tegula eiseni) were examined; results indicated that the interaction involved exploitation of microalgae and not interference. A behavioral exper- iment demonstrated that an individual of either species was less likely to feed on a recently grazed patch when the prior forager was T. aureotincta. Both snails responded only to the amount of food available on a patch, and, except at very low food levels, the likelihood that a snail would remain to feed was identical for the two species across microalgal densities. Where food was scarce, T. eiseni was more likely than T. aureotincta to feed in that patch. Density-dependent effects on microalgal standing stock differed between the snails; at low grazer densities, T. aureotincta depressed food levels to a comparatively greater degree, whereas at high grazer densities, T. eiseni had a relatively greater effect. The relative growth performance of the snails differed as a function of available food: T. aureotincta had superior body growth at high resource densities, while T. eiseni grew comparatively better at low microalgal densities. Differences in effects on and growth responses to microalgae arose from dissimilar foraging characteristics of the snails. Compared with T. eiseni, T. aureotincta moved more rapidly while feeding, harvested twice as great an area per unit time, but was unable to crop microalgae as close to rock surfaces. While T. eiseni grazed a smaller area per unit time, it removed relatively more microalgae per area grazed. These differing suites of foraging attributes may represent a trade-off to harvest food at different densities: cropping closer to the substratum (area intensive grazing) yields more food when microalgae are scarce, but precludes grazing a larger area per unit time (area extensive grazing) through fast movement, which provides a greater food intake when microalgae are abundant. If an area extensive (moves faster)-intensive (digs deeper) trade-off is a common feature of benthic grazer systems, knowledge of this aspect could provide great predictive insight into the patterns and causes of density dependence arising from exploitation.},

The model was parameterized from field-collected data on fruit production and seed dispersal, behaviors and movement of patterns the key disperser, the spider monkey densities (?teles of dispersed and non-dispersed seeds, and direct estimates of seed paniscus), dispersal distances. Our model demonstrated that the spatial scale of dispersal for this V. was as spider monkeys seeds {\textgreater}100 a calophylla population large, routinely dispersed m, used threshold for The simulated seed shadow was commonly long-distance dispersal. heterogeneous, with high spatial variance in seed density resulting largely from behaviors and movement patterns of spider monkeys that aggregated seeds (dispersal at their sleeping sites) and that scattered seeds (dispersal during diurnal foraging and resting). The single-distribution kernels used to model underestimated this variance dispersal frequently dispersal substantially and poorly fit the simulated because and a seed-dispersal curve, primarily of its multimodality, mixture distribution always fit the simulated dispersal curve better. Both seed shadow heterogeneity and dispersal curve multimodality arose directly from these different dispersal to models that did not account processes for generated by spider monkeys. Compared our modeling of the seed shadow of this V. disperser behavior, approach improved prediction calophylla population. An important function of seed dispersal models is to use the seed shadows to estimate they predict components of plant demography, particularly seedling population dynamics and distributions. Our model demonstrated that improved seed shadow prediction for animal-dispersed plants can be accomplished by incorporating spatially explicit information on disperser behavior and movements, scales using large enough to capture routine such as mixture that long-distance dispersal, and using dispersal kernels, distributions, account for spatially aggregated dispersal.},

@article{Butler2012b,
abstract = {This article examines the effect of climate change on a type of armed conflict that pits pastoralists (cattle herders) against each other (range wars). Such conflicts are typically fought over water rights and/or grazing rights to unfenced/unowned land. The state is rarely involved directly. The rangeland of East Africa is a region particularly vulnerable to drought and livestock diseases associated with climate change. To analyze the possible effects of climate change on pastoral conflict, we focus our analysis on changes in resource availability, contrasting cases of abundance and scarcity. The role of resources is further contextualized by competing notions of property rights, and the role of the state in defining property and associated rights. We employ a contest success function (CSF) game-theoretic model to analyze the logic of range wars. This CSF approach emphasizes the low-level, non-binary nature of raiding behavior between pastoralist groups over limited natural resources. A central contribution of this approach is that the logic of raiding behavior implies a positive relationship between resources and conflict. This positive relationship is supported by several studies of the rangeland of East Africa, but is generally dismissed by the literature on the resource curse'. This relationship is contingent on other factors examined in the model, producing the following results. First, the level of property rights protection provided by the state generally reduces conflict between pastoralist groups. Second, if property rights protection is provided in a biased manner, then conflict between pastoralist groups increases. Third, severe resource asymmetries between two pastoralist groups will induce the poorer group to become bandits (focusing their efforts on raiding and not producing), while the richer group raids in retaliation.},

abstract = {In Sahel, land and resources are used, according to the seasons, by various actors with interests sometimes difficult to conciliate. This spatial competition for the access to the natural resources induces a set of processes leading to overgrazing and conflicts for the access to water. In such a complex agro-sylvo-pastoral context, acquiring and formalizing knowledge about the practices and rules which govern the system are essential to help and accompany the rural populations towards the sustainable management of their environment. Among the new modelling tools coming from the field of Artificial Intelligence, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are now widely used to tackle the issue of integrated natural resource management. The increase in popularity of ABMs is partially due to their intelligibility, not only by scientists from various research fields, but also by stakeholders. It then becomes easier to build an understandable representation of the system as an “artificial world” and to perform simulations in order to collectively test and discuss various scenarios about the resource management. This paper describes an ABM which has been designed to formalize the interactions between the biophysics dynamics of the natural resources and the socio-economic factors driving the land-use dynamics around the drilling of Thieul village in the sylvo-pastoral area of Ferlo (Senegal). The first results show that rainfall still plays an extremely significant role in the pastoral system despite the drilling of boreholes. Paradoxically, steady rainfall over long periods of time can lead to negative effects on the relations between herders and farmers.},

abstract = {Pastoralism represents a complex adaptive system that has existed in Inner Asia for thousands of years. The challenges of environmental change have highlighted the need to assess the potential for long-term sustainability while also considering the characteristics of systems that have the potential to maintain resilience. Here we assess the interaction between slow and fast processes and how interpretations of adaptive capacity and system resilience are affected by the scale at which observations are made. Agent-based modeling is used to identify the social and demographic interactions between landscape and weather variability for pastoralists in Inner Asia at a variety of social scales and from temporal scales of societal change ranging from a few days to 1000 years. Results indicate that the scale of abrupt changes may not be proportional to the severity or duration of the weather event, but is highly impacted by internal social factors. At the scale of individual families, highly interconnected social systems with less mobility and restricted decision making are less effective. When viewed from the vantage point of larger social units, highly interconnected kinship systems and restrictions in access to land may serve purposes that are counterproductive for individual families. ?? 2011.},

Since the colonial era, representations of Inner Asia have been dominated by images of fierce nomads organized into clans and tribes-but as Sneath reveals, these representations have no sound basis in historical fact. Rather, they are the product of nineteenth-century evolutionist social theory, which saw kinship as the organizing principle in a nonstate society. Sneath.

The ecological basis of transhuming pastoralism in western Rajasthan is described and an attempt is made to make a case for the long-term sustainability of pastoral practice. The chronology and social composition of mobility is examined and it is shown that mobility is a critical element in the region's adaptation to drought and scarcity. The impact of the penetration of markets on the practice of pastoralism is assessed and the issue of conflict over rights and restraints on pastoral grazing is discussed. It is concluded that pastoral autonomy is threatened by its contradictions with the policies and perspectives of the state, rather than due to fundamental conflict with the broader economy.},

There are many similarities, functional some to the pastoral nomadic way of life, some due to historical relationship. But there are also differences; the types of nomadism now found would seem to be the result of different though related origins. Since nomads leave few remains for the archaeol- ogist to study, and the Asian pastoralists were late in acquiring writing, any attempt to reconstruct the development of Asiatic pastoral nomadism in its varying aspects must necessarily be inferential, and to some extent speculative.

Major causal factors are the artisan's knowledge and experience, extent of feedback on performance in activities along the artifact's behavioral chain, situational factors in behavioral chain activities, technological constraints, and social processes of conflict and negotiation. In identifying the causal factors at work in a specific case, the investigator must focus analytically on activities-that is, on people-people, people-artifact, and artifact-artifact interactions-and on the performance characteristics relevant to each. Application of this behavioral framework allows abandonment of many cherished but unhelpful concepts, including style and function.

This study considers what is being implicitly assumed about the mean–variance relationship in distance-based analyses – multivariate analyses based on a matrix of pairwise distances – and what the effect is of any misspecification of the mean–variance relationship. 3. It is shown that distance-based analyses make implicit assumptions that are typically out-of-step withwhat is observed in real data,which hasmajor consequences. 4. Potential consequences of this mean–variance misspecification are: confounding location and dispersion effects in ordinations; misleading results when trying to identify taxa in which an effect is expressed; failure to detect amultivariate effect unless it is expressed in high-variance taxa. 5. Data transformation does not solve the problem. 6. A solution is to use generalised linearmodels and their recent multivariate generalisations, which is shown here to have desirable properties.},

abstract = {The Prisoner's Dilemma has long been considered the paradigm for studying the emergence of cooperation among selfish individuals. Because of its importance, it has been studied through computer experiments as well as in the laboratory and by analytical means. However, there are important differences between the way a system composed of many interacting elements is simulated by a digital machine and the manner in which it behaves when studied in real experiments. In some instances, these disparities can be marked enough so as to cast doubt on the implications of cellular automata-type simulations for the study of cooperation in social systems. In particular, if such a simulation imposes space-time granularity, then its ability to describe the real world may be compromised. Indeed, we show that the results of digital simulations regarding territoriality and cooperation differ greatly when time is discrete as opposed to continuous.},

Many studies of postdispersal seed fate use seed removal as an index of seed secondary seed dispersal can play an important role in plant recruitment, many researchers continue to use seed removal as a proxy for seed predation and are focused too intently on only the initial step of seed fate. We describe, using examples from the recent literature, how the results of some seed removal studies may have been misinterpreted, present plau- sible, alternative explanations for the fate of seeds in those studies, and discuss the im- portance of detailed studies of seed fates. Following the fates of seeds can be difficult, but such studies contribute much more to our understanding of seed dynamics and plant fitness.},

abstract = {We emphasize the necessity of a complex approach to evaluating vegetation change at various levels of abstraction. The analytical steps include comparisons at the data, derived variable, distance, ordination and classification levels. A variety of data randomization methods incorporated in testing the significance of changes in raw data are introduced and compared. It is shown that these are true alternatives to Procrustean comparisons, which offer an apparently unfortunate choice in the presence/absence case. We propose to evaluate nearest neighbor relationships among quadrats in a new method, called adjacency analysis, to detect temporal trends thatmayremainunrevealed, should our attention be paid to full distance structures only.Asan illustration, compositional and structural changes in the rock grassland vegetation of the Sas-hegy Nature Reserve (Budapest, Hungary), intensively sampled by quadrats in 1977 and 2000, are evaluated. Permutation tests show that differences between the 2 years aremuchsmaller than expected by chance alone. Such an overall stability incommunity structure, however, does notmeanthat minor aspectsof vegetationpattern are invariant over the years. Changes in life form and seed mass spectra are explained by the fluctuation of hemicryptophytes and the slight but detectable expansion of annuals and woody species. Classification is slightly rearranged in time, with clearly detectable within-cluster changes, also depicted in ordination scattergrams.},

@article{Liu1996a,
abstract = {In the third millennium B.C., the Longshan culture in the Central Plains of northern China was the crucial matrix in which the first states evolved from the basis of earlier Neolithic societies. By adopting the theoretical concept of the chiefdom and by employing the methods of settlement archaeology, especially regional settlement hierarchy and rank-size analysis, this paper introduces a new approach to research on the Longshan culture and to inquiring about the development of the early states in China. Three models of regional settlement pattern correlating to different types of chiefdom systems are identified. These are: (1) the centripetal regional system in circumscribed regions representing the most complex chiefdom organizations, (2) the centrifugal regional system in semi-circumscribed regions indicating less integrated chiefdom organization, and (3) the decentralized regional system in noncircumscribed regions implying competing and the least complex chiefdom organizations. Both external and internal factors, including geographical condition, climatic fluctuation, Yellow River's changing course, population movement, and intergroup conflict, played important roles in the development of complex societies in the Longshan culture. As in many cultures in other parts of the world, the early states in China emerged from a system of competing chiefdoms, which was characterized by intensive intergroup conflict and frequent shifting of political centers. However, what is unusual about the Chinese case is the fact that the earliest states did not develop from the most complex of the chiefdom organizations, but from the least complex chiefdom systems then existing there.},

Fundamental collective behaviors such as group formation, cultural transmission, combat, and trade are seen to "emerge" from the interaction of individual agents following a few simple rules.

A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing.

abstract = {This paper draws attention to the central role played by the Ethiopian state in reconfiguring contemporary (agro-)pastoral conflicts in its semi-arid lowlands. Contrary to primordialist and environmental conflict theories of pastoralist violence, we shed light on the changing political rationality of inter-group conflicts by retracing the multiple impacts of state-building on pastoral land tenure and resource governance, peacemaking and custom- mary authorities, and competition over state resources. Based on an exten- sive comparative review of recent case studies, post-1991 administrative decentralisation is identified as a major driving force in struggles for re- sources between transhumant herders in Ethiopia's peripheral regions. Our analysis emphasises the politicisation of kinship relations and group identities and the transformation of conflict motives under the influence of the gradual incorporation of (agro-)pastoral groups into the Ethiopian na- tion-state. Ethnic federalism incites pastoralists to engage in parochial types of claim-making, to occupy territory on a more permanent basis and to become involved in 'politics of difference' with neighbouring groups},

abstract = {Pastoral mobility in the arid and semi-arid rangelands of East Africa has been identified as a means to reduce the risk of having insufficient forage in any one location and as a coping strategy for reducing exposure to a restricted resource base and losses to droughts. It is however difficult to replicate the factors affecting mobility rates in the field because many dynamic simultaneous variables, and field studies often have low or uneven sample size that limit analysis (Johnson et al., 1989). Spatially explicit, complex adaptive models of pastoralist herds movement and foraging behavior can be helpful in understanding how the interaction of socio-cultural, landscape and biophysical patterns might affect patterns of movements of pastoralist in these semi-arid to arid rangelands. An agent based-model named the Pastoral Livestock Movement Model (PLMMO) was developed to demonstrate how innovative parsimonious models can inform process- based understanding of these complex pastoral systems of East Africa. The model was developed and applied to the semi-arid rangeland region extending from southern Ethiopia to northern Kenya. The model was used to investigate temporal adaptation of pastoralists to the spatial heterogeneity of their environment. PLMMO is a spatially explicit, individual-based pastoralists-animal foraging and movement model. Users can create or replicate heterogeneous landscape patterns, and place resources and individual pastoralists and their livestock on that landscape to simultaneously simulate the foraging and movement behavior of the pastoralists in a rangeland ecosystem. The heuristic rules for pastoralists' behavior can be used to explore hypotheses concerning the influence of landscape pattern on pastoralists' movement and foraging behavior across different seasons and under different social and ecological constraints. Pastoralists herd mobility patterns and other measures of movement were compared to data from field studies. Predictions of the model correspond to observed grazing patterns across the seasons. The distances moved were found to be significantly correlated to the drought and non-drought climatic regimes. The movement model proved useful at simulating general movement patterns of pastoralists relative to movement range sizes in the pastoral rangelands southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. This model captured the heterogeneity of resource use by pastoralists and comparative differences in moved distances in search for resources during the drought and non- drought phases. The Spatial outputs for the model are a series of dynamic maps showing simulated pastoral populations every ten days, which provide a reliable representation of seasonal pastoralist mobility patterns and grazing pressures at any time of the year.},

The failure to tackle the root causes of pastoral violence is constraining development across much of the global south. Key to mitigating these conflicts is to recognise that pastoral livelihoods are a fundamental element of rural economies, and to find ways to integrate them into the formal economy while strengthening the capacity of these communities to adapt to changing environmental and social conditions.},

This research contributes an important comparative perspective on processes of complex sociopolitical organization practiced among mobile groups. This essay employs a novel approach to understanding the organizational techniques and methods of finance that supported large-scale imperial polities of eastern Eurasia, specifically those centered on the Mongolian steppe. Using full-coverage survey data from the northern Mongolian valley of Egiin Gol, we present the results of diachronic spatial and environmental analyses in order to evaluate current models for nomadic political economy. We argue that eastern Eurasian subsistence economics are best understood not as a single "type" of production but as a productive process based on multiresource capacities (agro-pastoral, hunting, gathering, fishing) and the flexibility to readily adjust resource emphasis, degree of mobility, and specialization relative to a changeable environment. We offer a revised model for eastern steppe political integration emphasizing the spatial management of political relationships within a mobile setting. Our essay concludes with a brief overview of the potential for Eurasian steppe archaeology to contribute novel comparative insights for anthropologists studying the diversities and commonalities of complex social organization.},

abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The teststatistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

Key components of these simulations are representations of initial settlement populations that are demographically and socially plausible, and detailed models of social mechanisms that can produce and maintain realistic textures of social structure and dynamics over time. The simulation engine has broad applicability and is also being used to address modern problems such as agroeconomic sustainability in Southeast Asia. This article describes the simulation framework and presents results of initial studies, highlighting some social system representations.},

@article{Boone2011b,
abstract = {Historically, pastoral people were able to more freely use the services their semi-arid and arid ecosystems provide, and they adapted to changes in ways that improved their well-being. More recently, their ability to adapt has been constrained due to changes from within and from outside their communities. To compare possible responses by pastoral communities, we modeled ecosystem services and tied those services to decisions that people make at the household level. We created an agent-based household model called DECUMA, joined that model with the ecosystem model SAVANNA, and applied the linked models to southeastern Kajiado District, Kenya. The structure of the new agent-based model and linkages between the models are described, and then we demonstrate the model results using a scenario that shows changes in Maasai well-being in response to drought. We then explore two additional but related scenarios, quantifying household well-being if access to a grazing reserve is lost and if access is lost but those most affected are compensated. In the second scenario, households in group ranches abutting the grazing reserve that lost access had large declines in livestock populations, less food energy from animal sources, increased livestock sales and grain purchases, and increased need for supplemental foods. Households in more distant areas showed no changes or had increases in livestock populations because their herds had fewer animals with which to compete for forage. When households neighboring the grazing reserve were compensated for the lease of the lands they had used, they prospered. We describe some benefits and limitations of the agent-based approach.},

@article{Abdi2003a,
abstract = {This paper explores the changes in early forms of pastoralism in the West Central Zagros Mountains from village-based herding in the Neolithic period to initial stages in the formation of full-fledged nomadic pastoralism by the Late Chalcolithic period. It has been argued that the initial development of pastoralism in the Central Zagros Mountains should be viewed as an adap- tive strategy to a highland environment with limited and dispersed resources in order to supplement a primarily agricultural village-based economy.With expansion of the agricultural regime, the distance to be traveled to pastures by herders became greater, and as a consequence, the organization of labor involved in herding had to be modified to meet the more complex task ofmov- ing sizable herds over larger areas. The empirical evidence for the assessment of hypotheses proposed in this paper comes from archaeological fieldwork in the Islamabad Plain in the Zagros Mountains in western Iran, as well as previous archaeological and ethnographic research in the region.},

@article{Egozcue2005,
abstract = {Amalgamation of parts of a composition has been extensively used as a technique of analysis to achieve reduced dimension, as was discussed during the CoDaWork'03 meeting (Girona, Spain, 2003). It was shown to be a non-linear operation in the simplex that does not preserve distances under perturbation. The discussion motivated the introduction in the present paper of concepts such as group of parts, balance between groups, and sequential binary partition, which are intended to provide tools of compositional data analysis for dimension reduction. Key concepts underlying this development are the established tools of subcomposition, coordinates in an orthogonal basis of the simplex, balancing element and, in general, the Aitchison geometry in the simplex. Main new results are: a method to analyze grouped parts of a compositional vector through the adequate coordinates in an ad hoc orthonormal basis; and the study of balances of groups of parts (inter-group analysis) as an orthogonal projection similar to that used in standard subcompositional analysis (intra-group analysis). A simulated example compares results when testing equal centers of two populations using amalgamated parts and balances; it shows that, in certain circumstances, results from both analysis can disagree.},

@book{Khazanov1994a,
abstract = {The main argument of the book is that specializations means more dependency: the more specialized mobile pastoralists become, the more dependent they become, in turn, on the outside, non-pastoralist, mainly sedentary world. The book concentrates mainly on their economic and socio-political dependence, leaving aside their cultural and ideological dependence. However, it is important to keep in mind that pastoralists, including pastoral nomads, were culturally and ideologically dependent upon sedentary societies, just as they depended upon them in economic respects. The economic dependence of nomads on sedentary societies and their different modes of political adaptation to them, carried corresponding ideological implications. The introduction discusses the phenomenon of nomadism, myths and problems, followed by five chapters which examine: nomadism as a distinct form of food-producing economy; the origins of pastoral nomadism; the social preconditions of the relations between nomads and the outside world; modes of nomadic adaptation to the outside world; and nomads and the state.},

abstract = {We explore settlement structures and hierarchy found in different archaeological periods in northern, specifically the Khabur Triangle (KT), and southern Mesopotamia (SM) using a spatial interaction entropy maximization (SIEM) modeling and simulation method. Regional settlement patterns are investigated in order to understand what feedback levels for settlement benefits, or incentives, and abilities to move or disperse between sites in a landscape and period could have enabled observed settlement structures to emerge or be maintained. Archaeological and historical data are then used to interpret the best results. We suggest that in the Late Chalcolithic (LC) and first half of the Early Bronze Age (EBA), the KT and SM appear to have comparable urban patterns and development, where settlement advantage feedbacks and movement are similarly shaping the two regions for those periods. Within period variations, such as restrictions to population diffusion or movement in the EBA, are possible. In the KT during the Middle Bronze Age (MBA), multiple centers begin to emerge, suggesting a lack of social cohesion and/or political fragmentation. This is similar to SM in the MBA, but we also see the emergence of a single, dominant site. In the Iron Age (IA), movement in the KT likely becomes the least constrained in all assessed periods, as socio-political cohesion facilitates this process, with small sites now the norm and dominance by one state over the region is evident. For the same period in SM, a single site (Babylon) obtains significant settlement advantages relative to its neighbors and easy movement enables it to become far larger in size and likely socially, economically, and politically dominant. Overall, the results demonstrate that the method is useful for archaeologists and social theorists in allowing them to compare different archaeological survey results, with varied spatial dimensions and diachronically, while providing a level of explanation that addresses empirical settlement patterns observed.},

This is not restricted solely to the affected elements, but also affects general concentrations. This is due to the compositional nature of chemical data, enclosed by the restriction of unit sum. Since it is impossible to know prior to data treatment whether the original compositions have been changed by such processes, the methodological approach used in provenance studies must be robust enough to handle materials that might have been altered or contaminated. The ability of the logratio transformation proposed by Aitchinson to handle compositional data is studied and compared with that of present data treatments. The logratio transformation appears to offer the most robust approach.},

Like scatter plots, biplots are useful for detecting patterns and for displaying the results found by more formal methods of analysis.In recent years the theory of biplots has been considerably extended. The approach adopted here is geometric, permitting a natural integration of well-known methods, such as components analysis, correspondence analysis, and canonical variate analysis as well as some newer and less well-known methods, such as nonlinear biplots and biadditive models.},

The culture of the Negev Bedouin stands in sharp contrast to that of the westernized Israeli Jews. The Bedouin live as an Arab Muslim minority within a Jewish state whose people have until very recently been in political conflict with their Arab neighbours. Such a cultural and political gap generates conflicting forces that can drive change in unpredictable directions. Focusing on the structural consequences of the shift to sedentarization, an exploration is presented of the related socio-spatial issues of the encounter with the modern, westernized world within a settlement frontier context: the adaption of territorial behaviour; the adoption of western demographic patterns; changes in the social status of individual; integration into a system of social services; and the spatial conflict between state governments and pastoral nomads.},

abstract = {Population learning can be described as the iterative Darwinian process of fitness-based selection and genetic transfer of information leading to populations of higher fitness. Life-time learning describes the process of learning undertaken by individuals in a population during their lifetime. These two learning models are often simulated using genetic algorithms and neural networks, respectively, and can be used to evolve efficient neural networks for a variety of tasks. Cultural learning describes the process of information transfer between indi- viduals in a population through non-genetic means. Typically this is achieved through communication or the creation of artifacts available to all members of a population. Cultural learning has been simulated by combining genetic algorithms and neural networks using a teacher/pupil scenario where highly fit individuals are selected as teachers and instruct the next generation. This thesis examines the effects of cultural learning on a population of evolving neural network agents inhabiting an environment where they must solve a number of problem tasks. Three benchmark sequential decision tasks have been chosen as the evolutionary task for the population: connect-four, tic-tac-toe and blackjack. A number of experiments were carried out for each task, each with two pop- ulations. The first employed population learning alone and the second employed both population and cultural learning. The experiments measured the fitness of each population as well as their genetic and behavioural diversity in a stable and a dynamic environment. vi},

This paper presents an example from the Egiin Gol Survey project in which current models for nomadic polity development were evaluated against spa- tial data collected from a valley in north central Mongolia. The survey presented method- ological challenges since no prior systematic survey had been conducted in Mongolia and the mobility of steppe groups likely produced significant variation in social scales across the region in question. To address these factors, we did not select a pre-defined survey area with a fixed boundary. Instead, we expanded our regional perspective by creating zones of differ- ent survey resolution and applying knowledge of site location from higher resolution surveys to areas still unstudied. Through this nested resolution method, we acquired data at pro- gressively lower cost, enlarged our survey coverage dramatically, and accounted for shifts in socio-spatial scales relevant to our research problem.},

abstract = {In the South Caucasus-roughly the territory of today's Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan-the transition from the Middle Bronze Age (MBA) to the Late Bronze Age (LBA) is equated with fundamental shifts in settlement patterns, subsistence economy, and political strategies. During the mid-2nd millennium BC, nomadic pastoral societies that had dominated the region began to settle down and construct stone fortresses along the foothills of the Lesser Caucasus; these fortifications largely replaced the expansive and often opulently adorned kurgan burials as the most prominent expression of political dominance on the landscape. After a decade of intensive archaeological study at various fortifications, very little remains known about the political and economic relationships among fortresses on a regional scale that might improve our understanding of the roots of these sociopolitical transformations. In this paper, we highlight the results of a recent neutron activation analysis (NAA) of ceramics from elite and non-elite contexts at a selection of LBA fortresses on the Tsaghkahovit Plain in northwestern Armenia, and offer some preliminary interpretations about political and economic organization and boundary formation. Most strikingly, the NAA data suggest that the fortresses on the Tsaghkahovit Plain appear to have isolated themselves economically from surrounding valleys, perhaps in an attempt to forge boundaries and legitimating ideologies attendant to new political formations that were quite distinct from their nomadic predecessors in the MBA. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Alizadeh2010,
abstract = {Abstract: Archaeological and historical reconstructions and interpretations of the origins and development of early state organizations and nomadic-sedentary relations have been viewed primarily from the perspective of sedentary farmers and urban centers. Implicit in such models are assumptions of asymmetric power relationships in which nomads are viewed as not only dependent on settled farmers but also encapsulated within the sphere of urban civilizations. This unidirectional view of political economy also derives from an overdependence on the skewed and biased ancient literature and some twentieth century ethnographic views of nomads in relation to powerful nation-states. This paper offers a series of alternative inferences that are based on well-known archaeological data, as well as a few recent lines of evidence, and a review of relevant archaeological evidence for the existence of social hierarchy and stratification in prehistoric pastoral nomadism in southwestern Iran. In addition, we discuss how vertical mobile pastoralism in the region could have developed independent of settled farmers and how the events that developed in highland Iran resulted in the peculiar characters and features of what we know as Elamite civilization.},

@book{Harris2010,
abstract = {In Origins of Agriculture in Western Central Asia, archaeologist David R. Harris addresses questions of when, how, and why agriculture and settled village life began east of the Caspian Sea. The book describes and assesses evidence from archaeological investigations in Turkmenistan and adjacent parts of Iran, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan in relation to present and past environmental conditions and genetic and archaeological data on the ancestry of the crops and domestic animals of the Neolithic period. It includes accounts of previous research on the prehistoric archaeology of the region and reports the results of a recent environmental-archaeological project undertaken by British, Russian, and Turkmen archaeologists in Turkmenistan, principally at the early Neolithic site of Jeitun (Djeitun) on the southern edge of the Karakum desert. This project has demonstrated unequivocally that agropastoralists who cultivated barley and wheat, raised goats and sheep, hunted wild animals, made stone tools and pottery, and lived in small mudbrick settlements were present in southern Turkmenistan by 7,000 years ago (c. 6,000 BCE calibrated), where they came into contact with hunter-gatherers of the "Keltiminar Culture." It is possible that barley and goats were domesticated locally, but the available archaeological and genetic evidence leads to the conclusion that all or most of the elements of the Neolithic "Jeitun Culture" spread to the region from farther west by a process of demic or cultural diffusion that broadly parallels the spread of Neolithic agropastoralism from southwest Asia into Europe. By synthesizing for the first time what is currently known about the origins of agriculture in a large part of Central Asia, between the more fully investigated regions of southwest Asia and China, this book makes a unique contribution to the worldwide literature on transitions from hunting and gathering to agriculture.},

Associations between botanical and faunal remains suggest a continuum of land- use practices.

At the other, low wild/cereal ratios along with high proportions of the bones of cattle, pig, and hare indicate an economy more focused on agriculture. Based on the millennium-long sequence analyzed, the most sustainable land use around the ancient settlement emphasized pastoral production; only during the wealthy Middle Phrygian period did high population support greater reliance on agriculture.},

abstract = {Vulnerability to climate change and other hazards constitutes a critical set of interactions between society and environment. As transitional economies emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union, the republics of Central Asia are particularly vulnerable due to (1) physical geography (which dominated by temperate deserts and semi-deserts), (2) relative underdevelopment resulting from an economic focus on monoculture agricultural exports before 1991, and (3) traumatic social, economic, institutional upheavals following independence. Aridity is expected to increase across the entire Central Asian region, but especially in the western parts of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. Temperature increases are projected to be particularly high in summer and fall, accompanied by decreases in precipitation. We examine the concepts of vulnerability, adaptation, and mitigation in the context of climate change in Central Asia. We explore three major aspects of human vulnerability-food security, water stress, and human health-and propose a set of indicators suitable for their assessment. Non-climatic stresses are likely to increase regional vulnerability to climate change and reduce adaptive capacity due to resource deployment to competing needs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This book provides an overview of Bronze Age societies of Western Eurasia through an investigation of the archaeological record. Philip L. Kohl outlines the long-term processes and patterns of interaction that link these groups together in a shared historical trajectory of devel- opment. Interactions took the form of the exchange of raw materials and finished goods, the spread and sharing of technologies, and the movements of peoples from one region to another. Kohl reconstructs economic activities from subsistence practices to the production and exchange of metals and other materials. He also examines long-term processes, such as the development of more mobile forms of animal husbandry, which were based on the introduction and large-scale uti- lization of oxen-driven wheeled wagons and, subsequently, the domes- tication and riding of horses; the spread of metalworking technologies and exploitation of new centers of metallurgical production; changes in systems of exchange from those dominated by the movement of luxury goods to those in which materials essential for maintaining and securing the reproduction of the societies participating in the exchange network accompanied and/or supplanted the trade in precious materials; and increasing evidence for militarism and political instabilities as reflected in shifts in settlement patterns, including increases in fortified sites and quantitative and qualitative advances in weaponry. Kohl also argues forcefully that the main task of the archaeologist should be to write culture-history on a spatially and temporally grand scale in an effort to detect large, macrohistorical processes of interaction and shared devel- opment.},

@article{Barton2014,
abstract = {Social complexity has long been a subject of considerable interest and study among archaeologists; it is generally taken to refer to human societies consisting of large numbers of people, many social and economic roles, large permanent settlements, along with a variety of other marker criteria. When viewed from a more general complex systems perspective, however, all human societies are complex systems regardless of size or organizational structure. Complex adaptive systems (CAS) represent systems which are dynamic in space, time, organization, and membership and which are characterized by information transmission and processing that allow them to adjust to changing external and internal conditions. Complex systems approaches offer the potential for new insights into processes of social change, linkages between the actions of individual human agents and societal-level characteristics, interactions between societies and their environment, and allometric relationships between size and organizational complexity. While complex systems approaches have not yet coalesced into a comprehensive theoretical framework, they have identified important isomorphic properties of organization and behavior across diverse phenomena. $\backslash$nHowever, it is difficult to operationalize complex systems concepts in archaeology using the descriptive/confirmatory statistics that dominate quantitative aspects of modern archaeological practice. These are not designed to deal with complex interactions and multilevel feedbacks that vary across space and time. Nor do narratives that simply state that societies are characterized by interacting agent/actors who share cultural knowledge, and whose interacting practices create emergent social-level phenomena add much to our understanding. New analytical tools are needed to make effective use of the conceptual tools of complex systems approaches to human social dynamics. Computational and systems dynamics modeling offer the first generation of such analytical protocols especially oriented towards the systematic study of CAS. A computational model of small-scale society with subsistence agriculture is used to illustrate the complexity of even 'simple' societies and the potential for new modeling methods to assist archaeologists in their study.},

Contrary to primordialist and environmental conflict theories of pastoralist violence, we shed light on the changing political rationality of inter-group conflicts by retracing the multiple impacts of state-building on pastoral land tenure and resource governance, peacemaking and custom- mary authorities, and competition over state resources. Based on an exten- sive comparative review of recent case studies, post-1991 administrative decentralisation is identified as a major driving force in struggles for re- sources between transhumant herders in Ethiopia's peripheral regions. Our analysis emphasises the politicisation of kinship relations and group identities and the transformation of conflict motives under the influence of the gradual incorporation of (agro-)pastoral groups into the Ethiopian na- tion-state. Ethnic federalism incites pastoralists to engage in parochial types of claim-making, to occupy territory on a more permanent basis and to become involved in 'politics of difference' with neighbouring groups},

abstract = {Modern day Iran is strategically located in the tri-continental corridor uniting Africa, Europe and Asia. Several ethnic groups belonging to distinct religions, speaking different languages and claiming divergent ancestries inhabit the region, generating a potentially diverse genetic reservoir. In addition, past pre-historical and historical events such as the out-of-Africa migrations, the Neolithic expansion from the Fertile Crescent, the Indo-Aryan treks from the Central Asian steppes, the westward Mongol expansions and the Muslim invasions may have chiseled their genetic fingerprints within the genealogical substrata of the Persians. On the other hand, the Iranian perimeter is bounded by the Zagros and Albrez mountain ranges, and the Dasht-e Kavir and Dash-e Lut deserts, which may have restricted gene flow from neighboring regions. By utilizing high-resolution mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers and reanalyzing our previously published Y-chromosomal data, we have found a previously unexplored, genetic connection between Iranian populations and the Arabian Peninsula, likely the result of both ancient and recent gene flow. Furthermore, the regional distribution of mtDNA haplogroups J, I, U2 and U7 also provides evidence of barriers to gene flow posed by the two major Iranian deserts and the Zagros mountain range.},

abstract = {The author's His first aim is intention to fill in this thesis is twofold. a major lacuna in Middle Eastern ethnography by documenting with as much precision as possible the economics of tribal nomadic sheep and goat rearing an entire annual pastoral cycle. His second objective in the light of this economic description, to analyze the political structure of a tribal society in which nomadic pastoralism still plays an important role. Both themes are treated with specific reference to materials gathered during prolonged fieldwork among the tribes of Luristan, western Iran. After a brief excursion into recent Luri history to illustrate the genesis of the present situation, the author isolates the ecological and cultural constraints impinging in the late 1960s upon the behaviour patterns of different categories of Luri tribesmen and ranks these social categories according to the degree and type of members' involvement in the exploitation of various combinations of pastoral capital. He observes that the categories fall into two distinct groups. These may be said to constitute two separate social strata, between which there is little either upward or downward mobility. Using a model of social process originally developed by Prof. Fredrik Barth but here modified and employed in conjunction with certain tenets of systems theory to give it accrued flexibility, the author shows how the upper stratum enforces its absolute political hegemony over the lower by the exertion of monopolistic control over access to vital resources in a variety of spheres. In a concluding chapter attention is paid to far-reaching changes wrought in Luri tribal society since the late-1960s. These are explained as predictable ongoing variations in the overall scheme of Luri social organization generated by a series of major shifts in the external parameters of the model of process presented earlier.},

abstract = {The Framework for Addressing Cooperative Extended Transactions (FACET) is a flexible, object-oriented architecture for implementing models of dynamic behavior of multiple individuals, or "agents" in a simulation. These agents can be human (individuals or organizations) or animal, and may exhibit any type of organized social behavior that can be logically articulated. FACET was developed by Argonne National Laboratories (ANL) Decision and Information Sciences Division (DIS) out of a need to provide for the integration of societal processes into natural system simulations. The FACET architecture includes generic software components that provide the agents with various mechanisms for interaction such as step sequencing and logic, resource management, conflict resolution, and preemptive event handling. FACET components provide a rich environment within which patterns of behavior can be captured in a highly expressive manner. Interactions among agents in FACET are represented by "Course of Action" (COA) object-based models. Each COA contains a directed graph of individual actions, representing any known pattern of social behavior. The agents' behavior in a FACET COA in turn influences the natural landscape objects in a simulation (i.e. vegetation, soil, habitat) by updating their state. The modular design of the FACET architecture provides the flexibility to create multiple and varied simulation scenarios by changing social behavior patterns, with no disruption to the natural process models. This paper will describe the FACET architecture and present several examples of FACET models that have been developed to assess the effects of anthropogenic influences on the dynamics of the natural environment.},

The development of livestock husbandry appears to coincide with the advent of a drier Middle Holocene climatic, followed by a relatively fast expansion all over West Africa. Pastoral–nomadic strategies developed in the northern Saharan part are hardly distinguishable from Late Stone Age settlement–subsis- tence traditions, while genuine agro-pastoral systems emerged in the south, along the Sahara–Sahel margins. In all the cases, stone tumuli burials, rock art stations, and intermittent or permanent settlements were used as de facto territorial markers, effective signposts of West African Collector, herder, and peasant territoriality.},

abstract = {Pastoralism represents a complex adaptive system that has existed in Inner Asia for thousands of years. The challenges of environmental change have highlighted the need to assess the potential for long-term sustainability while also considering the characteristics of systems that have the potential to maintain resilience. Here we assess the interaction between slow and fast processes and how interpretations of adaptive capacity and system resilience are affected by the scale at which observations are made. Agent-based modeling is used to identify the social and demographic interactions between landscape and weather variability for pastoralists in Inner Asia at a variety of social scales and from temporal scales of societal change ranging from a few days to 1000 years. Results indicate that the scale of abrupt changes may not be proportional to the severity or duration of the weather event, but is highly impacted by internal social factors. At the scale of individual families, highly interconnected social systems with less mobility and restricted decision making are less effective. When viewed from the vantage point of larger social units, highly interconnected kinship systems and restrictions in access to land may serve purposes that are counterproductive for individual families. ?? 2011.},

Based on an investigation of a sample of plants, the present article argues that changes in farming attributed to the era of classical Islam were far more complex and distended than previously acknowledged.

abstract = {Archaeology has an opportunity to offer major contributions to our understanding of the long-term interactions of humans and the environment. To do so, we must elucidate dynamic socioecological processes that generally operate at regional scales. However, the archaeological record is sparse, discontinuous, and static. Recent advances in computational modeling provide the potential for creating experimental laboratories where dynamic processes can be simulated and their results compared against the archaeological record. Coupling computational modeling with the empirical record in this way can increase the rigor of our explanations while making more transparent the concepts on which they are based. We offer an example of such an experimental laboratory to study the long-term effects of varying landuse practices by subsistence farmers on landscapes, and compare the results with the Levantine Neolithic archaeological record. Different combinations of intensive and shifting cultivation, ovicaprid grazing, and settlement size are modeled for the Wadi Ziqlab drainage of northern Jordan. The results offer insight into conditions under which previously successful (and sustainable) landuse practices can pass an imperceptible threshold and lead to undesirable landscape consequences. This may also help explain long-term social, economic, and settlement changes in the Neolithic of Southwest Asia. La arqueologia tiene la oportunidad de contribuir en gran parte al conocimiento de las interacciones entre la humanidad y el medio ambiente sobre tiempos largos. Para realizarlo, hay que concretar los procesos dinamicos de la socioecologia que tienen lugar a escala regional. Sin embargo, el registro arqueologico es disperso, discontinuo, y estatico. Los recientes avances en el modelado de computo ofrecen el potencial de construir laboratorios de experimentacion donde se puede simular procesos dinamicos y contrastar los resultados comparados con el registro arqueologico. La combinacion de la modelizacion y el registro empirico puede incrementar el rigor de las explicaciones arqueologicas e igualmente hacer mas transparentes las ideas en que se basan. Presentamos aqui un ejemplo de tal laboratorio para el estudio de los efectos a largo plazo del uso de la tierra por campesinos sobre los paisajes, y comparar los resultados con el registro arqueologico del Neolitico Levantino. Combinaciones diferentes de cultivo intensivo y extensivo, del pastoreo de ovicapridos, y de asentamientos de varios tamanos se simulan para la cuenca del Wadi Ziqlab en el Norte de Jordania. Los resultados de tales experimentos proporcionan una nueva perspectiva sobre las condiciones en las que formas originalmente prosperas de agricultura pueden pasar un umbral imperceptible y tener consecuencias indeseables. Tambien pueden contribuir a entender los cambios sociales, economicos, y de pautas de asentamiento en el curso del Neolitico en el Proximo Oriente.},

Could nomadic tribes exhibit elements of urbanism or social hierarchies? How can the tools of historical, archaeological, and ethnographic research be integrated to build a dynamic picture of the social landscape of the Near East?

The geoarchaeological side of the programme focused on the drawing of a regional geomorphological map then on the identification, mapping and dating of the palaeochannels of the river of Balkh. We established the chronology of several fluvial channel generations by association with archaeological settlements of different eras (Bronze Age, Bactro-Achaemenid period, Kushan period, Islamic period) and with optically stimulated luminescence dating carried out on alluvium deposits. The present riverbed leading up to Aqcha was formed during the Islamic period. We suspect the primary agent of this change in the river channel to, be tectonic activity and the activation of a blind fault crossing the floodplain. We identified a northern Bactro-Achaemenid aqueduct, currently located in the desert area separating the plain of Balkh from the Amu Darya. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, the same social, political, economic, and religious institutions that help elucidate the spatial dimensions of politics in the LBA— shrines, workshops, storage spaces, cemeteries—also demonstrate that political claims and commitments to land did not likely resemble the neat borders of absolutist cartographies essential to modern nation-states.We detail potential models of territorial organization that incorporate the strategies of rule and socioeconomic dynamics derived from a decade of archaeological survey and excavation on the plain by Project ArAGATS},

abstract = {CORONA satellite photography taken in the 1960s continues to reveal buried ancient landscapes and sequences of landscapes – some of them no longer visible. In this new survey of the Mughan Steppe in north-western Iran, the authors map a ‘signature landscape' belonging to Sasanian irrigators, and discover that the traces of the nomadic peoples that succeeded them also show up on CORONA – in the form of scoops for animal shelters. The remains of these highly significant pastoralists have been virtually obliterated since the CORONA surveys by a new wave of irrigation farming. Such archaeological evaluation of a landscape has grave implications for the heritage of grassland nomads and the appreciation of their impact on history.},

abstract = {In 2002, the unexpected discovery of Hellenistic architectural blocks, buried in 8 m of alluvium, found displaced in a former bed of the river of Balkh, brought about a programme of surveys and excavations under the aegis of the French Archaeological Mission in Bactria. The geoarchaeological side of the programme focused on the drawing of a regional geomorphological map then on the identification, mapping and dating of the palaeochannels of the river of Balkh. We established the chronology of several fluvial channel generations by association with archaeological settlements of different eras (Bronze Age, Bactro-Achaemenid period, Kushan period, Islamic period) and with optically stimulated luminescence dating carried out on alluvium deposits. The present riverbed leading up to Aqcha was formed during the Islamic period. We suspect the primary agent of this change in the river channel to, be tectonic activity and the activation of a blind fault crossing the floodplain. We identified a northern Bactro-Achaemenid aqueduct, currently located in the desert area separating the plain of Balkh from the Amu Darya. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Even if we have an operative definition of Urartu as a ‘state', we are still missing some links between the historical reconstructed situation (where the theory of the ‘segmented state' comes from) and the archaeological evidence in the landscape. It is a link among the royal agency, the resulting socio-political structure and the ‘social objects' (i.e. the fortresses, settlement and infrastructure of Urartu) on the field. The main question I have tried to answer during my research is how the segmented state is truly reflected in the structure of the historical landscape and how the aforementioned social objects have been used to ‘mold' it.},

Among the popular approaches, agent-based methodologies are commonly used to answer questions involving the interactions of natural and social systems. Building upon such efforts, a new object-oriented simulation framework is being developed for ancient Mesopotamia that can assemble and execute highly complex simulation scenarios. This framework can be used to investigate socioecological interactions over a broad range of social, spatial, and temporal scales, allowing for a wide range of past socioecological issues to be concurrently addressed. Such capabilities are enabled by simulation tools that are flexible, scalable, and highly expressive. Perhaps the greatest promise of these tools for studying the past is their potential for enabling scholars to gain new insights by testing various theoretical hypotheses and perspectives in social-natural systems in a rich socioecological simulation context.},

An initial focus on the practicalities of archaeological investigation describes the social as well as economic aspects of productive specialization, many of which are not defined by specific depositional features and are thus not always clearly readable in the archaeological record. These difficulties, in addition to the highly variable character of pastoralism as a secondary activity within a mixed farming adaptation or a principal investment combined with other pursuits, make the question of origins a very complex one. Although an earlier appearance of specialized mountain nomadism is possible, a scenario based upon a number of archaeological indications is offered for its emergence concomitant to the growth of urbanism and centralized political organization in the Luristan region.},

abstract = {In recent years environmental archaeologists have emphasized evidence for human-caused degradation, and attention has been focused on the role of our discipline in debates over contemporary socioenvironmental problems. In a recent American Antiquity forum, van der Leeuw and Redman (2002) argue that current environmental research would benefit from an archaeological perspective on these problems, and that our discipline would benefit from more active engagement in the larger debate. I present research supporting the claim that archaeology has unique and compelling insights to offer socio-natural studies. I make arguments based on spatial statistical and GIS analyses of past land use in the Wadi al-Hasa, west-central Jordan, that environmental degradation in the form of soil erosion has been a problem for agropastoralists in that region for several millennia. Furthermore, I argue that an archaeological perspective on long-term patterns of land use provides information at a scale and resolution that makes it highly suitable for studies of human-environment dynamics. Archaeology's unique data and perspective create an opportunity to contribute in a more explicit manner to the study of contemporary environmental issues that currently lack long-term focus at a scale and resolution that is meaningful to humans. ␥ En anos recientes arqueologos con interes en el ambiente han enfatizado en la evidencia de la degradacion ambiental causada por seres humanos y se ha atencion dado al rol de nuestra disciplina en debates sobre problemas socio-ambientales contemporaneos. Recientemente, en un foro de American Antiquity, van der Leeuw y Redman (2002) argumentan que las investigaciones ambientales de hoy se beneficiarian a traves de una perspectiva arqueologica, pero tambien nuestra disiciplina se beneficiaria de una participacion mas activa en este gran debate. Presento en mis investigaciones resultados que argumentan que la arqueologia provee una perspectiva unica y urgente para los estudios de caracter socio-natural. Argumento, basado en analisis de estadisticas espaciales y SIG (GIS) sobre el uso anterior de la tierra en el Wadi al-Hasa en la parte occidente-central de Jordania donde la degradacion ambiental en forma de erosion de suelos ha sido un problema para agropastores en esa region por miles de anos. Ademas, argumento que una perspectiva arqueologica sobre patrones del uso de la tierra a largo plazo provee informacion a una escala y resolucion que lo hace altamente valioso para el estudio de las dinamicas de la interaccion del ambiente y humanos. Los datos y la perspectiva unica de la arqueologia generan oportunidades para contribuir, de una manera especifica, a los estudios de problemas ambientales contemporaneas que hoy les falta un enfoque de amplio espectro y a una escala y resolucion que tenga un significado para los seres humanos.},

There are many similarities, functional some to the pastoral nomadic way of life, some due to historical relationship. But there are also differences; the types of nomadism now found would seem to be the result of different though related origins. Since nomads leave few remains for the archaeol- ogist to study, and the Asian pastoralists were late in acquiring writing, any attempt to reconstruct the development of Asiatic pastoral nomadism in its varying aspects must necessarily be inferential, and to some extent speculative. A bringing together of available data may, however, suggest lines for further investigation.},

abstract = {Archaeological investigations of pastoral economies often emphasize exchange relations with agricultural populations, though for Bronze Age Eurasia the notion of a ubiquitous ‘pastoral realm' has masked various forms of mixed subsistence economies. In Central Asia, there are few attempts to specifically identify the domestic crops utilized by mobile pastoralists or what they may suggest about the role of agriculture in mobile pastoral production or subsistence strategies. This study reports the macrobotanical remains from two Late/Final Bronze Age (ca. 1950–1300 bc) mobile pastoralist habitation sites in the Murghab alluvial fan region of southern Turkmenistan. We compare our results with published macrobotanical data from contemporary agricultural settlements in the Murghab region, as well as with other sites in broader prehistoric Eurasia. We find that mobile pastoralists in the Murghab utilized some of the same domestic crops as their sedentary neighbors. While the data presented here do not preclude the possibility that mobile pastoralists may have practiced some low-investment cultivation (particularly of millet), we hypothesize an economic model that places mobile pastoralists in direct contact with nearby sedentary farming communities through exchange for pre-processed grains. These results highlight one of the possible strategies of mobile pastoral subsistence in Central Asia, and are a further step toward identifying the various degrees of agricultural involvement in the conceptually outdated pastoral realm of Eurasia.},

Fifteen craniometric variables from 12 Bronze Age samples--encompassing 544 adults from Central Asia, Iran, the Indus Valley, and Anatolia--are compared to test which, if any, of the current hypotheses offered by archaeologists are best supported by the pattern of phenetic affinities possessed by the Oxus Civilization inhabitants of the north Bactrian oasis. Craniometric differences between samples are compared with Mahalanobis generalized distance, and patterns of phenetic affinity are assessed with two types of cluster analysis (WPGMA, neighbor-joining method), multidimensional scaling, and principal coordinates analysis. Results obtained by this analysis indicate that current hypotheses for both the origin and interregional impacts of Oxus Civilization populations are incomplete.},

The chronological and ethnocultural attributes, and the theory that sites are related to the Asian military campaign of Alexander the Great are discussed. Archaeological expeditions conducted over several years in western Ustyurt and Mangyshlak revealed more than a dozen Early Iron Age sanctuaries. Analysis of some sanctuaries indicate that they are a unique complex of a type previously unknown throughout the Eurasian steppes. The sanctuaries display commonalities including stone anthropomorphic statues (more than 100 have been recovered), and stone sacrificial structures with the main feature being a round cultic construction up to 10 m in diameter; the latter has parallels with the Zoroastrian dakhma, although no trace of human bones or burials were recovered. It is presumed that the sculptures represent deceased ancestors. The discovery of large monolithic altars, known as “sacrificial tables,” suggest that the sites possibly were linked to a cult involving fire and liquids while Sarmatian tamgas on several sculptures indicate the presence of a Sarmatian population at the Ustyurt sanctuaries.},

Social models are contradicted by the ethnographic record and beg as many questions as they address, and adaptive models are hampered by a faulty understanding of evolutionary processes and contradicted by the fact that the ostensible “benefits” of sedentism are not true benefits at all. This article explores the concept of population pressure, often naively used in the past, and relates it to evolutionary processes. It proposes that in certain contexts increased sedentism is both innovatively generated by population pressure and independently selected for by it. It further proposes that the primary advantage to increased sedentism is ensured access to the most productive portions of a territory in the context of increasing competition. Thus increased sedentism will tend to develop whenever the energetics of the situation favor the abandonment of less productive or difficult‐to‐defend portions of an existing territory—when the risks and costs of defending the status quo come to exceed the risks and costs of exploiting a smaller territory more intensively.},

Key components of these simulations are representations of initial settlement populations that are demographically and socially plausible, and detailed models of social mechanisms that can produce and maintain realistic textures of social structure and dynamics over time. The simulation engine has broad applicability and is also being used to address modern problems such as agroeconomic sustainability in Southeast Asia.

A lack of well-stratified settlements and a focus on artifacts that are not necessar- ily appropriate for assessing the effects of imperial control have until now obfuscated our understanding of this issue. In this article, we present the results of three seasons of excavations at Akra located in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan. Although research was cut short in 2001 by global events, our preliminary results indicate that the relationship between urbanism, trade, and the Achaemenid annexation was considerably more complex than previously argued by scholars. Akra experienced rapid growth in settlement at the beginning of the first millen- nium B.C., several centuries before the Achaemenids ruled this area, and exhibited contacts with regions in both peninsular India and Central Asia during this time. When we are able to return to Pakistan, we hope to investigate further the causes of this settlement expansion and trade},

abstract = {The aim of the present study is to document the evolution of the lactase persistence trait in Central Asia, a geographical area that is thought to have been a region of long-term pastoralism. Several ethnic groups co-exist in this area: Indo-Iranian speakers who are traditionally agriculturist (Tajik) and Turkic speakers who used to be nomadic herders (Kazakh, Karakalpak, Kyrgyz, Turkmen). It was recently demonstrated that horse milking practice existed in the Botai culture of Kazakhstan as early as 5,500 BP ( Outram et al. 2009 ). However, the frequency of the lactase persistence trait and its genetic basis in Central Asian populations remain largely unknown. We propose here the first genotype-phenotype study of lactase persistence in Central Asia based on 183 individuals, as well as the estimation of the time of expansion of the lactase-persistence associated polymorphism. Our results show a remarkable genetic-phenotypic correlation, with the causal polymorphism being the same than in Europe (-13.910C{\textgreater}T, rs4988235). The lactase persistence trait is at low frequency in these populations: between 25{\%} and 32{\%} in the Kazakh population (traditionally herders), according to phenotype used, and between 11{\%} and 30{\%} in the Tajiko-Uzbek population (agriculturalists). The difference in lactase persistence between populations, even if small, is significant when using individuals concordant for both excretion of breath hydrogen and the lactose tolerance blood glucose test phenotypes (P = 0.018, 25{\%} for Kazakh vs. 11{\%} for Tajiko-Uzbeks), and the difference in frequency of the -13.910*T allele is almost significant (P = 0.06, 30{\%} for Kazakhs vs. 19{\%} for Tajiko-Uzbeks). Using the surrounding haplotype, we estimate a date of expansion of the T allele around 6,000-12,000 yrs ago, which is consistent with archaeological records for the emergence of agropastoralism and pastoralism in Central Asia.},

abstract = {Pastoral systems may be envisaged as a product of a number of interacting variables: the characteristics of the animals, the environment, and of the human culture. Animal physiological and behavioural characteristics affect their suitability to different climatic, topographical and ecological environments. This paper attempts to advance our understanding of the environmental factors constraining animal husbandry on the prehistoric Eurasian steppe, an area that exhibits a broad range of environmental conditions, through comparisons of data on archaeological animal bone assemblages and historic and modern herd compositions (specifically the proportions of cattle, sheep/goats and horse). There are strong biases towards different taxa dependent on region. The consistencies between the later prehistoric animal bone data and the modern and historic livestock herd compositions indicate the constraining role of the environment on the pastoral economies practiced across the Eurasian steppe, in that pastoral strategies appear to be focussing on species best adapted to regional environments. Other patterns may be indicative of socioeconomic trends, such as the relatively low proportions of horse herded in modern times. The results indicate variability in herd compositions across the study area being influenced in part by regional climatic, topographical and ecological conditions. Thus, it is suggested, that part of the variability seen in herd compositions is environmentally determined, with herders making decisions based on the animals' biological and behavioural characteristics. Better understanding of the environmental constraints on pastoral economies will enable us to address a range of questions relating to past pastoralists, and allow us to better assess the cultural factors at play.},

The ecological basis of transhuming pastoralism in western Rajasthan is described and an attempt is made to make a case for the long-term sustainability of pastoral practice. The chronology and social composition of mobility is examined and it is shown that mobility is a critical element in the region's adaptation to drought and scarcity. The impact of the penetration of markets on the practice of pastoralism is assessed and the issue of conflict over rights and restraints on pastoral grazing is discussed. It is concluded that pastoral autonomy is threatened by its contradictions with the policies and perspectives of the state, rather than due to fundamental conflict with the broader economy.},

The culture of the Negev Bedouin stands in sharp contrast to that of the westernized Israeli Jews. The Bedouin live as an Arab Muslim minority within a Jewish state whose people have until very recently been in political conflict with their Arab neighbours. Such a cultural and political gap generates conflicting forces that can drive change in unpredictable directions. Focusing on the structural consequences of the shift to sedentarization, an exploration is presented of the related socio-spatial issues of the encounter with the modern, westernized world within a settlement frontier context: the adaption of territorial behaviour; the adoption of western demographic patterns; changes in the social status of individual; integration into a system of social services; and the spatial conflict between state governments and pastoral nomads.},

abstract = {The Tarim Basin ‘mummies'of western China continue to fascinate scholars and the general public alike due to their ‘Caucasoid' features, well- preserved material culture, and putative ‘European' origins. However, there have been some uncritical efforts to link these archaeological cultures to those of other ancient Eurasian groups (e.g. the Celts) by applying syllogistic reasoning to multi-disciplinary evidence. In an attempt to provide a more cautious synthesis of the prehistory of the Tarim Basin, this paper will briefly summarize the archaeological, physical, and linguistic evidence that has been used to model human settlement of this region. These data will then be related to recent molecular anthropology research on modern populations of Central Asia, focusing especially on the Uighur in relation to their neighbours. While the genetic history of the modern peoples of a particular region is not necessarily related to their prehistoric antecedents, it is argued that the Tarim Basin experienced a surprising cultural and biological continuity despite immigration from both east and west into Xinjiang Province. This conclusion has a number of possible political ramifications in the present day that must be addressed in future literature on the subject.},

abstract = {The non-Islamic 'Kafir' tribes of the Hindu Kush mountains, on the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan, provide an exceptional opportunity to examine indigenous ritual and moral values surrounding transhumant livestock husbandry in central Asia. Among the Kalasha of Chitral, whose traditional religion is uniquely preserved in this region, contrasting livestock values associated with goat husbandry are related to a basic dichotomisation of the natural environment into 'pure' and 'impure' ritual spheres. This symbolic polarity corresponds to an extreme division of agro-pastoral labour by sex and to related features of sexual antagonism characteristic of Kalasha social structure. A comparison of alternative animal values among neighbouring societies suggests that such contrastive livestock codes, as noted by Blok (1981) in the Mediterranean, are intrinsic elements of a more general pastoral ideology of opposed male and female domains characteristic of transhumant mountain communities throughout Eurasia.

abstract = {The scarcity of water is a major problem in many parts of the Near East today and has been so in the past. To survive in such a region peo- ple should be able to structurally attain more water than rainfall alone can supply. The archaeology of this area should not only identify when people inhabited such a region and what the character of this habitation was, but also how people were able to survive in such a region and why they chose to live there in the first place. In this book these questions have been studied for the Zerqa Triangle; a region in the middle Jordan Valley around Tell Deir ‘Allā (Jordan). By means of a detailed pedestrian archaeological survey the intensity of habitation of the region from the Neolithic to early modern periods is investigated. Efforts have been undertaken to reconstruct the agricul- tural practices in the various periods and simultaneously the means by which the different communities were able to practice agriculture; in other words, how did they irrigate the land? By focussing on the differ- ent social responses of communities conclusions have been drawn on how and why people managed to create a living in this arid, but poten- tially very fertile region. This book not only contributes to the ongoing discussion of the ar- chaeology of marginal areas, but also provides a huge amount of new data on the archaeology of the Jordan Valley, both in the form of newly discovered settlement sites from several different periods as well as re- mains from several more inconspicuous types of human activity present in the countryside.},

abstract = {The founding of the settlements on the Black Sea Coast by the Greeks dates back to the 7th and the 6th century B.C. It was a part of the so-called great Greek colonization. Most of the cities in north and west Pontos area have been founded by colonists from Miletus. Cities in this territory have become the key economic and political units, playing a significant role in the area of the continental Greece1. The Greek population came more often into contact with neighbouring tribes and founding of new trade centers took place in the area during this process. Scythians as well as Thracians have become the main trading partners for Greeks and their neighbours in the eastern Mediterranean. Bosphorus kingdom with its center in the city Pantikapaion was a significant trade area. The trade was oriented on ceramics, food, but also slaves. Written sources provide mainly epigraphic records (records of ownership) of various Greek colonial cities, but also reports from ancient authors. As far as the location is concerned, we will concentrate on today‘s Crimea area, northern Black Sea Coast, adjacent steppess and the Sea of Azov. This area is a part of today´s Ukraine and Russia. The main purpose of our article is to analyze the contacts between Greeks and Scythians in the Black Sea Area.},

abstract = {The emergence of coupled natural and human landscapes marked a transformative interval in the human past that set our species on the road to the urbanized, industrial world in which we live. This emergence enabled technologies and social institutions responsible for human-natural couplings in domains beyond rural, agricultural settings. The Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics Project (MedLand) is studying the interacting social and biophysical processes associated with these novel socioecological systems and their long-term consequences using a new form of 'experimental socioecology' made possible by recent advances in computation. We briefly describe the MedLand modeling laboratory, a hybrid simulation environment that couples models of small-holder farming and herding, landscape evolution, and vegetation change managed through an interaction model. We then review three examples of experimental socioecology carried out in this laboratory. These examples offer new insights for scale-dependent thresholds in agropastoral productivity, long-term sustainability of alternative land-use strategies, and identifying signatures of human and climate-driven landscape dynamics. We conclude with an overview of new directions for this interdisciplinary research on Anthropocene human-earth systems, including: modeling more diverse decision-making strategies for land-use, developing more sophisticated models of vegetation dynamics and fire ecology, and generating digital proxy data for more robust model validation against the empirical record.},

abstract = {Urbanization occupies an ambiguous position in the development of the Middle Euphrates region of Turkey and Syria, in part because the area frequently formed a contested region between other stronger Early Bronze Age polities. This paper aims to review evidence from a series of archaeological surveys to illustrate trends in settlement during the 4th and 3rd millennium BC. Re-analysis of survey data from three exemplar regions in the Middle Euphrates demonstrates that by including settlement away from the main Euphrates Valley we get a picture of two main zones of settlement corresponding to agro-ecological zones. In the northern zone, settlements underwent phases of nucleation and dispersal through time, but long-term configurations were relatively stable. In contrast, a southern zone, south of the Sajur Valley, was characterized by rapid colonization and some degree of boom and bust growth of towns, perhaps encouraged by the opportunities afforded by the high risk but high rewards of the {\&}{\#}8216;zone of uncertainty{\&}{\#}8217;. Although ecological conditions and climate change played a role in settlement growth and failure, in part by setting the parameters for agro-pastoral production, it is evident that socio-political circumstances, chronic conflict and sheer opportunism were probably key to both the growth and decline of the southern settlements.},

abstract = {The settlement of Tasbas is located in the Dzunghar Mountains of eastern Kazakhstan. This article illustrates an economy at the site in the Late Bronze Age (Phase 2a, 1490-1260cal.BC), which incorporated mixed agropastoralism or multiresource pastoralism. This economic model is significant in that it confirms the presence of Bronze Age agriculture in northern Central Asia, an area where the nature of early pastoralism and agriculture has been debated for decades. The archaeobotanical remains from Tasbas provide conclusive evidence for agricultural pursuits and suggest that by (at least) the mid-second millennium BC highland areas supported a complex system of agriculture using several distinct crop types. The Late Bronze Age assemblage from Tasbas has high ubiquities of: naked, six-rowed, split-apexed barley; highly compact, free-threshing wheat; green peas; and broomcorn millet. In addition, the presence of processing chaff (rachises) and impressions of culms and grains in mudbrick at the site support the argument that these crops were produced locally. The data presented here open new discussions concerning the integration of agriculture into Bronze Age pastoralist economies across CentralAsia and the diffusion of both domestic grains and modes of production during the second millennium BC.},

abstract = {With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, former Communist Party leaders in Central Asia were faced with the daunting task of building states where they previously had not existed — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Their task was complicated by the institutional and ideological legacy of the Soviet system as well as by a more actively engaged international community. These nascent states inherited a set of institutions that included bloated bureaucracies, centralized economic planning, and patronage networks. Some of these institutions survived, others have mutated, and new institutions have been created. Experts on Central Asia here examine the emerging relationship between state actors and social forces in the region. Through the prism of local institutions, the authors reassess both our understanding of Central Asia and of the state-building process more broadly. They scrutinize a wide array of institutional actors, ranging from regional governments and neighborhood committees to transnational and non-governmental organizations. With original empirical research and theoretical insight, the volume's contributors illuminate an obscure but resource-rich and strategically significant region.},

abstract = {The Negev is an arid desert, where the natural conditions do not allow for subsis- tence on agriculture. Nevertheless, remnants of ancient agriculture, particularly a tre- mendous network of terraced wadis, are scattered over an area exceeding 3000 km2. According to recent studies, the well-preserved remains of agricultural systems point to two waves of settlement. One wave was in the Byzantine period (fifth to seventh cen- tury C.E.), when settlements were dispersed along a strip extending 50 km south of the Beer Sheva Valley. The second wave, in the Umayyad period (seventh to eighth century C.E.), extended about 30 km beyond the Byzantine settlement. The expansion of agri- culture in the midst of the wilderness can be attributed to two developments. One was imperial policy during the Byzantine and Umayyad periods, which encouraged agri- cultural settlements on the frontier. The other was an anticipated process known to occur among seminomads living on the margins of permanent settlements. In this pro- cess, the seminomads gradually shifted from nomadism to spontaneous settlements, which culminated in sedentarization by the state.},

abstract = {The growing awareness about the need to anticipate the future of land systems focuses on how well we understand the interactions between society and environmental processes within a complexity framework. A major barrier to understanding is insufficient attention given to long (multidecadal) temporal perspectives on complex system behavior that can provide insights through both analog and evolutionary approaches. Analogs are useful in generating typologies of generic system behavior, whereas evolutionary assessments provide insight into site-specific system properties. Four dimensions of these properties: (1) trends and trajectories, (2) frequencies, thresholds and alternate steady states, (3) slow and fast processes, and (4) legacies and contingencies, are discussed. Compilations and analyses of past information and data from instruments and observations, palaeoenvironmental archives, and human and environmental history are now the subject of major international effort. The embedding of empirical information over multidecadal timescales in attempts to define and model sustainable and adaptive management of land systems is now not only possible, but also necessary.},

Both hypothesis are largely based on indirect evidence; only with resumed fieldwork in Southern Iran has it become possible to test some of the underlying assumptions. The following paper presents some preliminary results of fieldwork carried out in Northern Fars Province in the course of rescue work in 2005-2006 that was specifically focussed on testing the evidence for the existence of mobile pastoralist camp sites in the 5th millennium BC and the conditions for their location and discovery by the use of a geoarchaeological approach.},

abstract = {According to some classical authors, the region south-west of the Caspian Sea was inhabited by the large tribe of the Cadusians (Greek Κ$\alpha$$\delta$ο$\upsilon$$\sigma$$\iota$ο$\iota$, Latin Cadusii). During the Achaemenid Period, several armed conflicts between the Imperial Persian forces and the warlike Cadusians occurred. Of particular importance is the disastrous defeat of Artaxerxes II in 380 B.C. From the archaeological point of view, little has been known about the material culture of the Achaemenid Period (Iron Age IV) in Talesh and Gilan. Until recently, only a few burial contexts from the South of Gilan could be dated to the period between the 6th and 4th centuries B.C. However, during the last two decades, Iranian archaeologists excavated numerous Bronze and Iron Age graveyards in the Talesh Region. A number of burial contexts at sites, such as Maryan, Mianroud or Vaske can securely be dated to the Achaemenid Period. With this new material basis, it was possible to subdivide the Iron Age IV into different subsequent phases. Furthermore, it is likely that the material culture described in this article could be at least partially attributed to the Cadusians.},

abstract = {Central Asia is an area in which the main variants of pre-industrial economic productions coexisted for several thousand years. The relation between the different economic activities is known to have been unstable, with abundant examples of conflict at different geographical scales and most places having seen shifting patterns of land use change right up to the early 20th century. Here we present and discuss a model of interaction between mobile livestock breeding and sedentary agriculture, the Musical Chairs model. The model is implemented using Agent-Based modeling and describes a mechanism of competition for land between the two economic strategies. To complement a previous publication (Angourakis et al. 2013), this article deepens on the analysis of assumptions, implications and stable states (i.e., attractors) involved in this model. We discuss our results in light of archaeological and historical cases and conclude by defining lines for further exploration.},

Christoph Baumer's ambitious four-volume treatment of the region charts the 3000-year drama of Scythians and Sarmatians; Soviets and transcontinental Silk Roads; trade routes and the transmission of ideas across the steppes; and the breathless and brutal conquests of Alexander the Great and Chinghiz Khan. Masterfully interweaving the stories of individuals and peoples, the author's engaging prose is richly augmented throughout by colour photographs taken on his own travels. For all the complexity of the history, Dr Baumer, a noted authority on Central Asia, never loses sight of the sweeping grandeur of its overall setting. Volume 1 focuses on the geography of the area now occupied by present-day Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, northern Afghanistan, western and central Mongolia and parts of southern Russia and northern China. Discussing the changing climates of the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Ages, the author explores subjects as diverse as glacial retreat; the invention of the wheel; the legendary Cimmerians and Amazons; Hellenism and Zoroastrianism; and the Oxus Treasure. Future volumes will explore the later historical periods of the region.},

The adoption of double-cropping in the north, facilitated by agricultural innovation and intensification also allowed more effective cash-crop production in saqia irrigation made new labour demands, creating a demographic vacuum, while Nubia, including cotton and for a period grapes. The resulting increase in population and local wealth production provided the necessary economic foundation for an independent polity. The effect combined with savanna crop effect created a population sink in northern Nubia, which allowed saqia for the emergence of local peasantry on which a state system could be based. The foundation of the Qustul-Ballana state can be attributed at least in part to these economic developments.},

@article{Flohr2016,
abstract = {Climate change is often cited as a major factor in social change. The so-called 8.2 ka event was one of the most pronounced and abrupt Holocene cold and arid events. The 9.2 ka event was similar, albeit of a smaller magnitude. Both events affected the Northern Hemisphere climate and caused cooling and aridification in Southwest Asia. Yet, the impacts of the 8.2 and 9.2 ka events on early farming communities in this region are not well understood. Current hypotheses for an effect of the 8.2 ka event vary from large-scale site abandonment and migration (including the Neolithisation of Europe) to continuation of occupation and local adaptation, while impacts of the 9.2 ka have not previously been systematically studied. In this paper, we present a thorough assessment of available, quality-checked radiocarbon (14C) dates for sites from Southwest Asia covering the time interval between 9500 and 7500 cal BP, which we interpret in combination with archaeological evidence. In this way, the synchronicity between changes observed in the archaeological record and the rapid climate events is tested. It is shown that there is no evidence for a simultaneous and widespread collapse, large-scale site abandonment, or migration at the time of the events. However, there are indications for local adaptation. We conclude that early farming communities were resilient to the abrupt, severe climate changes at 9250 and 8200 cal BP.},

abstract = {This study helps to clarify the debate on the Western and Eastern genetic influences in Central Asia. Thirty-six skeletal remains from Kazakhstan (Central Asia), excavated from different sites dating between the fifteenth century BC to the fifth century AD, have been analysed for the hypervariable control region (HVR-I) and haplogroup diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the mitochondrial DNA genome. Standard authentication criteria for ancient DNA studies, including multiple extractions, cloning of PCR products and independent replication, have been followed. The distribution of east and west Eurasian lineages through time in the region is concordant with the available archaeological information: prior to the thirteenth-seventh century BC, all Kazakh samples belong to European lineages; while later an arrival of east Eurasian sequences that coexisted with the previous west Eurasian genetic substratum can be detected. The presence of an ancient genetic substratum of European origin in West Asia may be related to the discovery of ancient mummies with European features in Xinjiang and to the existence of an extinct Indo-European language, Tocharian. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the ancient DNA in unravelling complex patterns of past human migrations so as to help decipher the origin of present-day admixed populations.},

abstract = {Iron Age societies of the eastern Eurasian steppe are traditionally viewed as nomadic pastoralists. However, recent archaeological and anthropological research in Kazakhstan has reminded us that pastoralist economies can be highly complex and involve agriculture. This paper explores the nature of the pastoralist economies in two Early Iron Age populations from the burial grounds of Ai-Dai and Aymyrlyg in Southern Siberia. These populations represent two cultural groups of the Scythian World - the Tagar Culture of the Minusinsk Basin and the Uyuk Culture of Tuva. Analysis of dental palaeopathology and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes suggests that domesticated cereals, particularly millet, and fish formed a major component of the diet of both groups. The findings contribute to the emerging picture of the nuances of Early Iron Age subsistence strategies on the eastern steppe. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

These periods of the regional assessment have been mangled by a continuous dialectic between two processes or forces: “feudalism”, or centrifugal force, and “monarchic”, or centripetal force: “feudalism”, or centrifugal force, and “monarchic”, or centripetal force.4 Regional political agents such as local lords, households or provincial governors acted on the landscape developing and clustering their social, political and economical functions in geographically defined areas creating friendly relationships or struggling with the regional ruling power such as the Urartu, the Armenian Kingdom or the Arab Empire. The resulting local networks became collective agents shaped by and shaping this assessment and related networks. Aiming to define these local powers, the paper presents a GIS integrated methodology contextualised on these local networks: an attempt to try a new “network agents” interpretative approach through the use of GIS in landscape archaeology to support the whole analysis. This article is about the operative definition of this GIS application and also presents a related test of the results.},

abstract = {Despite the long historical and archaeological record of interaction between Mongol herders and Chinese agriculturalists, pastoralists in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia have resisted pressure to adopt subsistence economies dependant on the cultivation of plant foods. While some evidence suggests that many of these steppe regions are more ecologically suited to herding than farming, their northern frontiers have proven to be agriculturally viable. Therefore, the persistent resistance to sedentary agricultural modes of production should be traced to long‐standing cultural values at odds with sedentism and agricultural toils. By considering several lines of evidence, including environmental limitations and the constraints of pastoralist land‐use, Mongol resistance to the adoption of cultivation is seen as having been driven by the development of ideological systems incompatible with the adoption of agriculture.},

@article{Bah2006,
abstract = {In Sahel, land and resources are used, according to the seasons, by various actors with interests sometimes difficult to conciliate. This spatial competition for the access to the natural resources induces a set of processes leading to overgrazing and conflicts for the access to water. In such a complex agro-sylvo-pastoral context, acquiring and formalizing knowledge about the practices and rules which govern the system are essential to help and accompany the rural populations towards the sustainable management of their environment. Among the new modelling tools coming from the field of Artificial Intelligence, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are now widely used to tackle the issue of integrated natural resource management. The increase in popularity of ABMs is partially due to their intelligibility, not only by scientists from various research fields, but also by stakeholders. It then becomes easier to build an understandable representation of the system as an “artificial world” and to perform simulations in order to collectively test and discuss various scenarios about the resource management. This paper describes an ABM which has been designed to formalize the interactions between the biophysics dynamics of the natural resources and the socio-economic factors driving the land-use dynamics around the drilling of Thieul village in the sylvo-pastoral area of Ferlo (Senegal). The first results show that rainfall still plays an extremely significant role in the pastoral system despite the drilling of boreholes. Paradoxically, steady rainfall over long periods of time can lead to negative effects on the relations between herders and farmers.},

Adapting these methods to a study area of extremely large spatial and chronological dimensions and to a proportionally undersized sample set certainly tested the limits of the methods, but it also allowed a wide variety of questions to be answered.},

@article{Yang2015,
abstract = {A recent switch in the study of the beginning of agriculture is to demonstrate the increasingly closer interaction between people and the landscape and how this would have played a crucial role in the transition to agriculture. Understanding the palaeo-ecology of the local environments at key sites and its relationship with subsistence strategies is critical to an improved appreciation of such interactions. This article examines macro- and micro-plant remains discovered at two important sites in North China, both dated to around 10,000 cal. yr BP. These two sites, Zhuannian and Nanzhuangtou, are located on the terrace of the Bai River in the Yan Mountains and next to Baiyangdian Lake on the piedmont of the Taihang Mountains, respectively. The floral remains at these two sites provide a great opportunity to examine (1) post-Pleistocene subsistence strategies, (2) the increasing consumption of millets and grassy plants and its significance and (3) the intra-regional diversity in food exploitation and its relationships with local environments. While the macro-plant remains at Nanzhuangtou indicate the importance of aquatic plants in the palaeo-diet, those at Zhuannian suggest a tendency of exploiting tree plants. This significance of these diversified plant food exploitation strategies by the last hunter-gatherers should be paid more attention in future research. Our data also once again confirm the importance of millet consumption to these hunter-gatherers on the eve of millet domestication.},

@article{Alizadeh2014,
abstract = {The landscapes of the Sasanian Empire have been studied in detail and have been remarkably well interpreted during past few decades. Recent research in borderland areas has also increased our knowledge of Sasanian policies in borderlands. The Sasanian Empire is well known for massive construction work. Projects such as construction of fortifications and defensive walls, irrigation systems, fortified towns and cities in the Sasanian period usually are attributed to the reigns of Kawad I and his son Husraw I Anushirwan in the sixth century. This attribution mostly derives from historical documents in which Husraw is seen as primarily responsible for these massive projects. Recent archaeological re- searches in the Gorgān plain in the northeast of Iran and in Mughan Steppe in Iranian Azerbaijan have demonstrated the possibility of dating these projects earlier in the fifth century. This is significant because it may shed more light on the socio-political dynamics of the Sasanian Empire. Focusing on the Caucasus, especially on data acquired from the Mughan Steppe projects, I will try to place this new data and information in its socio-political context and reconsider earlier notions on borderlands of the Sasanian Empire. Regardless of insecurity in borderlands, the Sasanian Empire heavily invested in these areas. In this article, reviewing historical documents and archaeological data, I will argue that the imperial investments in the borderland areas represent a multi-purpose plan.},

abstract = {The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 focused international attention on this country for the first time in nearly a century. The need for reliable information has only become been greater. Because of their traditional xenophobia toward the West, successive Afghan governments have restricted the number of scholars permitted to undertake extensive fieldwork. For this reason Thomas Barfield's study of the Central Asian Arabs of Afghanistan is a welcome addition to the literature, a literature which is not likely to grow in the coming years as war, domestic unrest and restrictive travel policies continue to make the research environment in Afghanistan unfavorable. The Central Asian Arabs are a little-known people of northeastern Afghanistan. This book is an account of the changes that have taken place in their way of life over the twentieth century as they switched from a form of subsistence pastoralism to a cash economy. Barfield's research constitutes a substantial revision of the standard hypothesis on the economic and social status of nomadic pastoralists, as originally posited by Fredrik Barth. One of Barfield's main purposes is to provide a case study that illustrates the wide-ranging complexity of pastoral nomadism, its integration into a regional economy, and how structural changes have occurred within the pastoral economy itself.},

abstract = {Among the great civilizations of the world, Islam remains an enigma to Western readers. Now, in a beautifully illustrated historical atlas, noted scholar of religion Malise Ruthven recounts the fascinating and important history of the Islamic world. From the birth of the prophet Muhammed to the independence of post-Soviet Muslim states in Central Asia, this accessible and informative atlas explains the historical evolution of Islamic societies. Short essays cover a wide variety of themes, including the central roles played by "sharia" (divine law) and "fiqh" (jurisprudence); philosophy; arts and architecture; the Muslim city; trade, commerce, and manufacturing; marriage and family life; tribal distributions; kinship and dynastic power; ritual and devotional practices; Sufism; modernist and reformist trends; the European domination of the Islamic world; the rise of the modern national state; oil exports and arms imports; and Muslim populations in non-Muslim countries, including the United States. Lucid and inviting full-color maps chronicle the changing internal and external boundaries of the Islamic world, showing the principal trade routes through which goods, ideas, and customs spread. Ruthven traces the impact of various Islamic dynasties in art and architecture and shows the distribution of sects and religious minorities, the structure of Islamic cities, and the distribution of resources. Among the book's valuable contributions is the incorporation of the often neglected geographical and environmental factors, from the Fertile Crescent to the North African desert, that have helped shape Islamic history. Rich in narrative and visual detail that illuminates the story of Islamic civilization, this timely atlas is an indispensable resource to anyone interested in world history and religion. (20040503)},

The book concentrates mainly on their economic and socio-political dependence, leaving aside their cultural and ideological dependence. However, it is important to keep in mind that pastoralists, including pastoral nomads, were culturally and ideologically dependent upon sedentary societies, just as they depended upon them in economic respects. The economic dependence of nomads on sedentary societies and their different modes of political adaptation to them, carried corresponding ideological implications. The introduction discusses the phenomenon of nomadism, myths and problems, followed by five chapters which examine: nomadism as a distinct form of food-producing economy; the origins of pastoral nomadism; the social preconditions of the relations between nomads and the outside world; modes of nomadic adaptation to the outside world; and nomads and the state.},

abstract = {The present study aims to identify hotspots on the Asian steppe that were vulnerable to widespread drought events in the Northern Hemisphere during 1999–2002, using newly proposed indices of vegetation response (sensitivity and resilience) to drought. Drought sensitivity is defined as vegetation response to decreased precipitation from pre-drought to drought phases, and resilience is defined as response to increased precipitation from drought to post-drought phases. Thus, the sensitivity and resiliency indices SI and RI are similarly expressed as normalized change of vegetation relative to that of precipitation. We also develop new regionally adjusted indices SI r and RI r , to do an interregional comparison of vegetation dynamics. In general, the resilience (RI r or RI) was larger than sensitivity (SI r or SI) over the entire region, whereas they had similar amplitudes over a wetter region (forest steppe). This asymmetric response of SI r  {\textless} RI r , which manifested over the desert steppe/steppe regions, is explained by interannual change of plant species composition (i.e., larger ratio of annual/perennial species for the post-drought year of 2003). As for the steppe region, the Chinese section had much higher resilience during the post-drought year compared with the Mongolian one. This may be attributable to the larger annual/perennial ratio, but is not strongly related to grazing pressure. Spatial and temporal analyses of the indices identified locations where there was not resilience from drought-affected vegetation conditions despite increased precipitation, and/or where long-term stability of vegetation is under threat.},

GIS studies build on field research and analyses carried out in the area over the past decade (e.g. Allard et al. 2006, Houle 2009, 2010, Houle and Broderick 2011). Khanuy Valley is presently one of the few areas in Mongolia where Bronze Age research has systematically focused on locating and studying occupation areas (i.e. settlement sites; see Houle and Broderick 2011, for a discussion of the terminology used here). Earlier research has concentrated largely on monumental studies, especially on the khirigsuur monuments, the Mongolian equivalent of the kurgans encountered across the Bronze Age and Iron Age Eurasian steppe (e.g. Allard and Erdenebaatar 2005, Wright 2007).},

Located on the northeastern edge of a chain of agricultural settlements (Namazga IV) that span the northern foothill ecotone of the Kopet Dag, Sarazm sat on a crossroads of exchange and interaction. Being at the eastern extremity of this chain of sedentary villages, Sarazm is the key site for understanding the eventual diffusion of agriculture north into the mountains and steppe. The main purpose of this article is to present a long-awaited (previously unpublished) macrobotanical data set analysed in the late 1980s by George Willcox.

abstract = {Debate on the complex coevolution that has shaped interactions between forested ecosystems and humans through constantly evolving land-use practices over the past millennia has long been centered on the Mediterranean because this area is seen as the cradle for the birth and growth of agricultural activities. Here, we argue that the transition from hunting-gathering by Mesolithic foragers to the food-producing economy of Neolithic farmers was a main trigger of biological changes not only in the Mediterranean but also in the Black Sea and Azov Sea coasts through woodcutting, herding, fire and agriculture. Although the ecological erosion was clearly focused on forested ecosystems, this process seems to have fostered an increased biodiversity. We show, by focusing on the fertile coast of the Azov Sea, that (i) the first evidence of cereal cultivation and human-induced fire occurred in southern Russia 7000 years ago; (ii) the early development of agriculture was a major but discontinuous process; (iii) the coastal ecosystems were rapidly disturbed by anthropogenic activities; and (iv) the Neolithic was a critical threshold for the forested ecosystems of the coastal area. The impact of early anthropogenic pressures seems to have been largely neglected or underestimated for the period encompassing the Neolithic cultural phase.},

In order to sustain these settlements, variant cultivation techniques were practiced by local populations. Understanding the dynamics and implications of crop management practices requires that socio-ecological variables be addressed over recurrent crop cycles. This paper employs a coupled socio-ecological modeling approach that enables interactions between a quantitative environmental model and an agent-based social model by using the ENKIMDU simulation tool. The reconstructed landscape near the ancient city of Assur is used as the example setting to test the effectiveness of simulated cultivation strategies. These methods include sole dependence on biennial fallow and rainfall, gravity flow irrigation, application of manure, and the integration of all these approaches. Results obtained within ENKIMDU attempt to delineate agricultural constraints and potential benefits of the specific anthropogenic processes and strategies addressed. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

This is the earliest evidence of wheeled transport in the region, providing information on the type and construction of carts used by the early agriculturalists of the Middle East. The models represent two-wheeled carts with shafts that were apparently linked to a yoke. Judging by representations of the harness, bulls (possibly oxen) were the only draft animals. In the second half of the 3rd millennium BC, fourwheeled carts appeared at Altyn-Depe. The most common type had high walls and two shafts, drawn by a single animal - a camel or, less often, a bull. Under the increasingly arid climate, the camel became the principal draft animal in Western Central Asia. The two types of carts - two-wheeled and four-wheeled - attest to two periods of intense contacts between people of Southern Turkmenistan and those of the adjoining regions. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

Rather, they are the product of nineteenth-century evolutionist social theory, which saw kinship as the organizing principle in a nonstate society. Sneath.

The research presented here uses various proxy records to compare the changes in climate during the Bronze Age in the Malatya Plain in eastern Anatolia, which is situated at the northern extremity of northern Mesopotamia. Extensive agropastoral land use modeling was applied to three sites of different size and function in the Malatya Plain during the Early Bronze Age I period to simulate the varying scale and intensity of human impacts in relation to changes in the level of social organization, demography, and temporal length. The results suggest that even in land use types subjected to a light footprint, the scale and intensity of anthropogenic impacts change significantly in relation to the level of social organization.},

abstract = {This dissertation investigates pastoral adaptations, multi-resource economic strategies and monument construction and use diachronically in the Darkhad Depression of northern Mongolia. This program of research has utilized GIS analysis, predictive modeling, pedestrian survey, targeted excavation, experimental archaeology and ethnoarchaeology. The results of this research contribute to a more detailed understanding of how this region contributed to broader social, political and economic change in the Bronze and Iron Ages through the Xiongnu period (ca. 2500 BCE – 200 CE). Numerous models have been proposed to explain the transition from an agricultural economy to an agro-pastoral or fully nomadic economy. However, there are far fewer explanatory models for the incorporation or adoption of pastoralism into existing hunting, gathering and/or fishing economies. Furthermore, a hyper-focus on connections between China and Inner Asia has dominated discussions of inter-regional, inter-economic relationships. Such trends have overshadowed potentially earlier important relationships with groups to the north, including the hunter-gatherers of Lake Baikal, and early pastoralists of the Minusinsk Basin and Tuva (Russian Federation). This dissertation research, in contrast, has employed a holistic landscape approach that examined both ritual and domestic activity areas in order to model the introduction and integration of herding practices with existing hunting-gathering-fishing economies. Recent archaeological research in the Darkhad Depression of north-central Mongolia has investigated the ritual landscape and has concluded that the monuments in this region, while not particularly large, are the oldest of their kind known in Mongolia and neighboring regions of Kazakhstan and Russia. If these monuments are connected with new forms of a pastoral economy and hierarchical social organization, as some have suggested, this underscores the importance of this region for modeling early pastoralist orientations in Mongolia and perhaps more broadly within northeastern Asia. This dissertation examines these important late prehistoric developments and situates this work in the context of other recent and important archaeology projects within Mongolia. The results of this research contribute to a growing trend in the scholarship of early multi-resource pastoralists that highlights the varied ways in which domestic animals were incorporated into existing economies, impacting local and supra-local social, political and ritual practices and lifeways.},

abstract = {Endorheic or inland deltas, commonly found across the deserts of Central Asia, represent unique and dynamic ecotones that are still not fully understood. These regions of environmental and landscape transition as well as social liminality straddle the line between fertile, sustainable environments and less productive desertic regions less capable of sustaining significant human occupation. Because such boundary areas are dynamic and often unpredictable, they are excellent case studies through which to study the complex processes that have characterized human/environmental relationships throughout the late Holocene.This paper focuses on the local variability that characterizes these relationships in one such region, the terminal fan of the Murghab River in Turkmenistan. Populated since at least the late 5th millennium BP and likely earlier, the region has been variously described as an oasis environment in which desertic processes have been more or less stagnant throughout the late Holocene, or, alternatively, as a fertile, continuously occupied and heavily-cultivated alluvial fan in which desertification was a relatively late process, intensifying only in the mid 4th millennium BP. This paper presents geoarchaeological data from a series of test pits in the distal portion of the terminal fan to show that local-scale analysis indicates a far more complex interpretation, one shaped by the continuous and non-uniform interaction of aeolian and alluvial depositional environments, and one that bears substantially on human/landscape dynamics in the region. The late Holocene development of the distal fan is examined using proxy data from granulometric analysis, Loss on Ignition (LoI) and geochemical analysis, as well as a series of new OSL dates that refines the depositional chronology of the region. Ultimately, we show that landscape change throughout the Holocene has been characterized by pronounced variability at the local level not fully described by regional scale approaches. While differential aeolian encroachment, non-uniform alluvial processes, and climatic conditions bear significantly on the initial conditions for human occupation, human/environmental processes are ultimately co-evolutionary in nature.},

abstract = {This article examines the effect of climate change on a type of armed conflict that pits pastoralists (cattle herders) against each other (range wars). Such conflicts are typically fought over water rights and/or grazing rights to unfenced/unowned land. The state is rarely involved directly. The rangeland of East Africa is a region particularly vulnerable to drought and livestock diseases associated with climate change. To analyze the possible effects of climate change on pastoral conflict, we focus our analysis on changes in resource availability, contrasting cases of abundance and scarcity. The role of resources is further contextualized by competing notions of property rights, and the role of the state in defining property and associated rights. We employ a contest success function (CSF) game-theoretic model to analyze the logic of range wars. This CSF approach emphasizes the low-level, non-binary nature of raiding behavior between pastoralist groups over limited natural resources. A central contribution of this approach is that the logic of raiding behavior implies a positive relationship between resources and conflict. This positive relationship is supported by several studies of the rangeland of East Africa, but is generally dismissed by the literature on the ‘resource curse'. This relationship is contingent on other factors examined in the model, producing the following results. First, the level of property rights protection provided by the state generally reduces conflict between pastor- alist groups. Second, if property rights protection is provided in a biased manner, then conflict between pastoralist groups increases. Third, severe resource asymmetries between two pastoralist groups will induce the poorer group to become bandits (focusing their efforts on raiding and not producing), while the richer group raids in retaliation.},

abstract = {It is now well recognized that mobile herding subsistence patterns do not preclude the development of complex social organization, but debate continues over whether the development of such societies depends upon and requires interaction with already existing agricultural state-level societies. This is known as the ‘dependency' hypothesis. In the Mongolian case this debate centers on the Iron Age Xiongnu (ca. 209 BCE to 93 CE) and whether this polity of mobile herders resulted from indigenous political processes or from the influence of or interaction with sedentary agricultural neighbors to their south. In order to evaluate this, a number of concrete lines of inquiry are investigated in the present study through regional archaeological survey and small-scale excavations of fourteen Late Bronze Age (mid-second to mid-first millennia BCE) domestic contexts in a remote region far from the direct intersection with centers of power such as China, but where numerous monumental structures suggest complex social organizations, so as to investigate the early development of societal complexity in Mongolia and systematically and empirically evaluate the core variables and problematic aspects related to the development of ‘nomadic' polities (i.e. those stated in the dependency hypothesis), namely demography, subsistence, mobility, and political economy in relation to higher degrees of sociopolitical organizations. Results of the present study upend some of the ideas tied to the dependency hypothesis and suggest that while clear social hierarchies have not been identified within domestic contexts there does seem to be some level of social differentiation during the Late Bronze Age. Based on this evidence and the evidence from the impressive ritual and funerary monumental landscape, it is suggested that this period may represent the first stage in the emergence of political organization operating beyond the descent group and that relatively complex forms of sociopolitical organization among mobile pastoralists can and did indeed develop in remote regions far from the direct intersection with powerful sedentary agricultural state-level societies. Accordingly, it is also suggested that some of the foundations of Early Iron Age complex sociopolitical organization in central Mongolia were already being laid locally during the preceding Late Bronze Age.},

abstract = {Pastoral mobility in the arid and semi-arid rangelands of East Africa has been identified as a means to reduce the risk of having insufficient forage in any one location and as a coping strategy for reducing exposure to a restricted resource base and losses to droughts. It is however difficult to replicate the factors affecting mobility rates in the field because many dynamic simultaneous variables, and field studies often have low or uneven sample size that limit analysis (Johnson et al., 1989). Spatially explicit, complex adaptive models of pastoralist herds movement and foraging behavior can be helpful in understanding how the interaction of socio-cultural, landscape and biophysical patterns might affect patterns of movements of pastoralist in these semi-arid to arid rangelands. An agent based-model named the Pastoral Livestock Movement Model (PLMMO) was developed to demonstrate how innovative parsimonious models can inform process- based understanding of these complex pastoral systems of East Africa. The model was developed and applied to the semi-arid rangeland region extending from southern Ethiopia to northern Kenya. The model was used to investigate temporal adaptation of pastoralists to the spatial heterogeneity of their environment. PLMMO is a spatially explicit, individual-based pastoralists-animal foraging and movement model. Users can create or replicate heterogeneous landscape patterns, and place resources and individual pastoralists and their livestock on that landscape to simultaneously simulate the foraging and movement behavior of the pastoralists in a rangeland ecosystem. The heuristic rules for pastoralists' behavior can be used to explore hypotheses concerning the influence of landscape pattern on pastoralists' movement and foraging behavior across different seasons and under different social and ecological constraints. Pastoralists herd mobility patterns and other measures of movement were compared to data from field studies. Predictions of the model correspond to observed grazing patterns across the seasons. The distances moved were found to be significantly correlated to the drought and non-drought climatic regimes. The movement model proved useful at simulating general movement patterns of pastoralists relative to movement range sizes in the pastoral rangelands southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. This model captured the heterogeneity of resource use by pastoralists and comparative differences in moved distances in search for resources during the drought and non- drought phases. The Spatial outputs for the model are a series of dynamic maps showing simulated pastoral populations every ten days, which provide a reliable representation of seasonal pastoralist mobility patterns and grazing pressures at any time of the year.},

abstract = {Abstract At the heart of Central Asia, the Middle Zeravshan Valley and the city of Samarkand are crisscrossed by a complex system of canals derived from the Zeravshan river (Fig. 1). In agreement with the traditional theories proposed by soviet scholars and defended, in another context, by Wittfogel, it is usually assumed that a strong, long-term association exists between the management of this irrigation system and some form of centralized political power system. 10.1080/00438240802655302 Figure 1The Middle Zeravshan Valley (LANDSAT image), overlapped on a DEM showing the irrigated area (left).

The rulers however did not live here permanently but in seasonal palaces in the environs of the city. I have identified the Spring and Winter Palaces and been able to narrow down the possible sites of the Summer and Autumn Palaces. The Spring Palace (the Qarshi-"Suri" of Juvaini, the Gegenchaghan of Rashid al-Din and the Jiajianchahan-dian of Saolin-cheng of the Yuan shi) is located at the site known as Doityn Balgas, and the Winter Palace (the Ong-khin of the Rashid al-Din) I consider to be at the Shaazan-khot site. The sites of the Summer and Autumn Palaces are uncertain at this point. Judging from the location of the Spring and Winter Palaces, it is clear that the emperors moved over a distance of 450 km each year and a reconstruction of the migration route shows that the emperor had a domain of 14,000 square km. This area can be called the peri-urban area of Kharakhorum, the political, economic, and cultural centre of the Mongol empire.},

abstract = {The environment of the mountain-steppe-taiga of northern Mongolia is often characterized as marginal because of the high altitude, highly variable precipitation levels, low winter temperatures, and periodic droughts coupled with severe winter storms (known as dzuds). Despite these conditions, herders have inhabited this landscape for thousands of years, and hunter-gatherer-fishers before that. One way in which the risks associated with such a challenging and variable landscape are mitigated is through social networks and inter-family cooperation. We present an agent-based simulation, Ger Grouper, to examine how households have mitigated these risks through cooperation. The Ger Grouper simulation takes into account locational decisions of households, looks at fission/fusion dynamics of households and how those relate to environmental pressures, and assesses how degrees of relatedness can influence sharing of resources during harsh winters. This model, coupled with the traditional archaeological and ethnographic methods, helps shed light on the links between early Mongolian pastoralist adaptations and the environment. While preliminary results are promising, it is hoped that further development of this model will be able to characterize changing land-use patterns as social and political networks developed.},

abstract = {A pollen diagram was prepared from Lake Almalou, a volcanic crater wetland located on the eastern flanks of the Sahand Volcanic Complex in NW Iran. The core provides a 3700-year record of human activity and environmental change in an upland region. We attempt to relate vegetation changes to both climatic change and historical events. Variations of anthropogenic pollen indicators suggest several phases of intensified human activities. Two strongly expressed agricultural phases are dated at about 2450-2220 cal BP (Achaemenid Empire) and 230-30 cal BP (collapse of Safavid Dynasty to the modern period). Historical rather than climatic events appear to be the main controlling factors for upland land-use dynamics. Fruticulture has been practiced in the region at least since the Iron Age, reaching its maximum importance 1500-1250 cal BP during the reign of Sassanid Empire; it declined by the time of Islamic conquest of Iran (651 AD). The Little Ice Age is tangibly recorded by higher lake water levels most probably due to both lower summer temperatures and higher annual precipitations. Low values of cereal-type and cultivated tree pollen during this period may indicate a change in the lifestyle from the cultivation of fields and orchards to a more nomadic life dominated by summer pasture. The modern period (1850 AD onwards) is characterized by expansion of agricultural activities to upland areas and intensified pastoralism. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mobility in pastoral societies has often been treated as either a necessity for efficient pastoral production or else as a method of avoiding state power. Yet both the examples of itinerance in medieval Europe and the attested itineraries of medieval Inner Asian rulers suggest that power projection, not power avoidance, was a key component of Turco-Mongolian imperial mobility. By using new historico-geographical evidence, the itineraries of several pre-Chinggisid and Mongol empire figures—Ong Qa'an, Batu, {\"{O}}gedei, and M{\"{o}}ngke—may be mapped. The results show that imperial itinerance must be distinguished from pastoral mobility. They also show that movement in vast agglomerations of mob-grazing herds was not just a temporary response to military crisis but continued long into the peacetime of the Mongol empire. These results challenge a functionalist understanding of mobility and state structures in Inner Asia.},

abstract = {Between the 13th and 11th centuries BCE, most Greek Bronze Age Palatial centers were destroyed and/or abandoned. The following centuries were typified by low population levels. Data from oxygen-isotope speleothems, stable carbon isotopes, alkenone-derived sea surface temperatures, and changes in warm-species dinocysts and formanifera in the Mediterranean indicate that the Early Iron Age was more arid than the preceding Bronze Age. A sharp increase in Northern Hemisphere temperatures preceded the collapse of Palatial centers, a sharp decrease occurred during their abandonment. Mediterranean Sea surface temperatures cooled rapidly during the Late Bronze Age, limiting freshwater flux into the atmosphere and thus reducing precipitation over land. These climatic changes could have affected Palatial centers that were dependent upon high levels of agricultural productivity. Declines in agricultural production would have made higher-density populations in Palatial centers unsustainable. The 'Greek Dark Ages' that followed occurred during prolonged arid conditions that lasted until the Roman Warm Period. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We explore why some sites become relatively major settlements, while others diminish in the periods discussed. We assess how political and geographic constraints affect regional settlement transformations, while also accounting for uncertainty in the archaeological data. Model outputs indicate how the MBA settlement pattern contrasts from the IA for the same region when different factors affecting settlement size importance, facility of movement, and exogenous site interactions are studied. The results suggest the importance of political and historical factors in these periods and also demonstrate the value of a quantitative model in explaining emergent settlement size distributions across landscapes affected by different socio-environmental causal elements. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

@article{Hanks2009a,
abstract = {This paper evaluates conventional scholarship surrounding early metallurgy in the Eurasian steppe zone, with a particular focus on prehistoric developments in a region including northern Kazakhstan and the Southern Ural Mountains of the Russian Federation. Traditionally, the emergence of metallurgy in this region has been viewed either as peripheral to core developments in Mesopotamia, Europe and the Near East, or as part of a much larger zone of interaction and trade in metals and metal production technologies. Such views have deflected scholarship from pursuing questions concerning metallurgical production, consumption, trade and value, and their connection to local diachronic socioeconomic change. This paper examines these key issues through recent research programs in the steppe region, and in so doing offers an important comparative case study for early metallurgy. It is suggested that in order to develop a better understanding of early mining, metallurgy and socio-economic change in the central steppe region, new theoretical and methodological approaches are needed that highlight the unique characteristics of early mining communities and their relationships to micro-regional resources and concomitant local, in addition to long-distance, trade dynamics. These issues are discussed in light of current field research by the authors and their Russian colleagues on the Middle Bronze Age Sintashta development (2,100–1,700 BC) in the Southern Ural Mountains.},

@phdthesis{Macopiyo2005a,
abstract = {An agent based-model of mobility of pastoralists was developed and applied to the semi-arid rangeland region extending from southern Ethiopia to northern Kenya. This model was used to investigate temporal adaptation of pastoralists to the spatial heterogeneity of their environment. This dissertation describes the development, structure, and corroboration process of the simulation model, Pastoral Livestock Movement Model (PLMMO). PLMMO is a spatially explicit, individual-based pastoralists-animal foraging and movement model. It simultaneously simulates the foraging and movement behavior of individual pastoralists and their livestock in a rangeland ecosystem. Pastoralists' herd mobility patterns and other measures of movement were compared to data from field studies. Predictions of the model correspond to observed mobility patterns across seasons. The distances moved were found to be significantly correlated (r2 = 0.927 to 0.977, p{\textless}0.0001) to drought and non-drought climatic regimes. The PLMMO model therefore proved to be a useful tool for simulating general movement patterns of pastoralists relative to movement range sizes in the pastoral rangelands of southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. We then used the PLMMO model to explore the impact of emerging changes in rangeland use in the study area. The ways in which pastoralists' mobility patterns adapt to emerging challenges in the study area were explored by simulating the following four scenarios: 1) climate change with concomitant reduction in forage yield, 2) climate change with concomitant improvement and higher variability in forage yield, 3) increased livestock population densities and 4) improved access to water. The climate induced change scenario with increased and more variable forage production resulted in the shortest distances moved by pastoralists in comparison to all other scenarios. The total search distances under this scenario were only 20{\%} of normal season distances. The improved water access scenario also returned a significant (p=0.017) drop in distances moved. There was, however, no significant impact on either increase in livestock numbers or reduction in available forage on mobility. We judged the agent-based model PLMMO developed here as a robust system for emulating pastoral mobility in the rangelands of eastern Africa and for exploring the consequences of climate change and adaptive management scenarios.},

abstract = {The Zhunge'er (Junggar) Basin in northern Xinjiang was a key crossroads in antiquity for the dispersal of ideas and technological innovations from the Eurasian steppe into the heartland of central China. The Bronze Age chronology of the Zhunge'er Basin is chiefly based on relative dating and little is known about subsistence strategies, although the strong tradition of nomadic and transhumant pastoralism among modern populations suggests that there may have been a high degree of mobility. The visibility of ancient cemeteries and the need to salvage graves before they are looted have resulted in a lack of focus on settlements, with a consequent assumption that in antiquity agriculture played a limited role. This assumption has been challenged by rescue excavations at the Jimusa'er (Jimsar) Luanzagangzi site, which indicate that agriculture may have been a significant component of Bronze Age subsistence strategies. Small-scale soundings at settlement sites provide well-stratified sequences of material for absolute dating which can be used to place the artifacts recovered from graves in a more secure chronological context.},

In doing so, we targeted non-alluvial areas where feature preservation was likely, and employed pedestrian survey methods more typical of Mediterranean fieldwork. If Mesopotamian archaeology is to investigate the landscapes of pastoral nomads, it must incorporate intensive survey methods and expand coverage beyond alluvial environments.},

abstract = {The evolution of Mediterranean landscapes during the Holocene has been increasingly governed by the complex interactions of water and human land use. Different land-use practices change the amount of water flowing across the surface and infiltrating the soil, and change water's ability to move surface sediments. Conversely, water amplifies the impacts of human land use and extends the ecological footprint of human activities far beyond the borders of towns and fields. Advances in computational modelling offer new tools to study the complex feedbacks between land use, land cover, topography and surface water. The Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics project (MedLand) is building a modelling laboratory where experiments can be carried out on the long-term impacts of agropastoral land use, and whose results can be tested against the archaeological record. These computational experiments are providing new insights into the socio-ecological consequences of human decisions at varying temporal and spatial scales.},

The data, collected using various site recognition methods and analysed by periods, have offered an interesting picture of substantial changes in settlement patterns, which are well related to the political and economic changes deducible from the archaeological infor- mation obtained at Arslantepe. However, problems and questions have also arisen: they involve both methodological aspects (a survey conducted in an intensively cultivated plain with thick alluvial and colluvial deposits) and the organisational peculiarities of a ‘non- urban' administrative, political and religious ‘centre'.},

abstract = {A sediment core 7.2??m long from Lake Mirabad, Iran, was examined for loss-on-ignition, mineralogy, oxygen-isotopic composition of authigenic calcite, and trace-element composition of ostracodes to complement earlier pollen and ostracode-assemblage studies. Pollen, ostracode-inferred lake level, and high Sr/Ca ratios indicate that the early Holocene (10000 to 6500??cal yr BP) was drier than the late Holocene. Low ??18O values during this interval are interpreted as resulting from winter-dominated precipitation, characteristic of a Mediterranean climate. Increasing ??18O values after 6500??cal yr BP signal a gradual increase in spring rains, which are present today. A severe 600-yr drought occurred at ca. 5500??cal yr BP, shortly after the transition from pistachio-almond to oak forest. During the late Holocene, two milder droughts occurred at about 1500 and 500??cal yr BP. Within the resolution of the record, no drought is evident during the collapse of the Akkadian empire (4200-3900??cal yr BP). Rather, a decrease in ??18O values to early-Holocene levels may indicate the return to a Mediterranean precipitation regime. ?? 2006 University of Washington.},

We reconstruct the hitherto unrecorded economy of high mountain pastoralists who lived at the site from the mid-3rd to early 1st millennium B.C. We argue that within the broad dynamics of mountain pastoralism there is local variability as shown through multi-season residence, farming, and craft production. In bringing together multiple data sets to address how the site was used we 1) show that ceramics were locally produced with similar manufacture technology across eight centuries - which breaks significantly from the canonical cultural history and large-scale migration paradigms that have defined the regional archaeology for decades; 2) identify a new tradition of cremation ritual (3rd millennium B.C.), and; 3) present the earliest evidence (3rd millennium B.C.) for the local use of domesticated grains and then farming (2nd millennium B.C.) in northern Central Asia. We provide a unique case study to bear on debates concerning the relationship between long-term regional stability and technological innovations among early central Eurasian pastoralists.},

Since the nineteenth century, it has generally been accepted that the Indo-European homeland was within the confines of Europe, delimited either by the northern Black Sea coastal area [Prichernomor'e] or by a triangle between the Rhine, the Danube, and the Dnieper. It was assumed that the Indo-Iranian nationalities had left the original homeland toward the east, into the Eurasian steppes, where later a part of them (the ancestors of the Scythians, Sauromatians, Massagetai, and Saka) remained, while others moved on to the south and migrated through the territory of Central Asia into India and Iran.

Expansion of the irrigation network, particularly since the late 1950s, has significantly increased the countrys agricultural output, especially of cotton. While problems of waterlogging and salinisation of Turkmenistans irrigation systems have been reported in the past, detailed information has only recently been readily available to western researchers. Data from the mid-1980s onwards indicates that there has been a significant increase in the area of land where the water table is less than 2 m below the surface and more and more land is becoming saline. Declining soils and water quality has significant implication for future agricultural development and could thwart Turkmeni- stans plans to diversify its agricultural base from one almost entirely dependent on cotton to one that will enable the countrys food requirements to be met.},

abstract = {Following a brief description of the traditional pastoral society and the complementarity and/or conflicts between farmers and pastors in North Africa and West Asia region, authors discussed the recent evolution of pastoral system dominated by fallow. They describe the current systems based mainly on rangeland, sedentary small holders mixed farming, and the more recent sedentary intensive system. Most of these systems are located in low rainfall areas of the WANA region and are facing dramatic feed shortage and drought management risks. Feed calendar witnesses of the importance of barley grain as a supplement feed for small ruminants and the relative failure of crop-livestock integration in most of the countries. Rangeland contribution to small ruminant feed requirements is decreasing and barley cultivation is invading the best rangelands, and steppe zones. Therefore, desertification, loss of soil and natural resources is of first concern for the region. Stubble plays a key in filling the summer feeding gap. Crop residues from cereals and olive tree are playing a more and more important role in almost all the countries. The current systems may be improved through the implementation of some technologies such as (i) the promotion of alternative feed resources; (i¡) the fallow replacement with adapted (native) legumes; (iii) the promotion of on-farm shrubs planting and their integration with cereal crops production (alley-cropping). Some examples of complementarity between conventional feeds and shrubs are discussed and illustrate the real potential of such integration.},

Nomadic movement is highly purposeful and is oriented toward achieving specific production or other goals. Commonly nomadic mobility is used to advance production goals in a number of diverse sectors. However, nomadism is not tied to one type of economic system; some nomads have generalized, consumption-oriented production, while others are specialized and market-oriented. Nor is nomadism limited to one type of land tenure; some nomads migrate within a territory that they control, while others have no political or legal claim over the land they use. Furthermore, some pastoral nomads live in isolated regions far from other populations, while others live close to peasant and urban populations. Pastoral nomads vary in political structure from state-controlled peasants, to centralized chiefdoms, to weak chiefdoms, to segmentary lineages systems.},

These results contradict the commonly held view that certain comparatively gracile (narrow-faced) Bronze Age populations of Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan were "Mediterranean" in the anthropological sense, i.e. Southern Caucasoid. Craniometry provides no support for the theory that those people migrated to Southern Siberia or Kazakhstan from Southwestern Central Asia, the Near East, or Trans-Caucasia. Populations described as "Mediterranean" (the Okunev people of Tuva, the Yelunino, the Samus, and some Afanasiev and Andronov groups) display craniometric resemblance with the Bronze Age people of Southern Russian and Ukrainian steppes, as well as with certain Late Neolithic and Bronze Age groups of Central and Western Europe. These affi nities are apparently caused by migrations of Indo-Europeans (specifi cally Indo-Iranians) from their European homeland eastward, as far as Eastern Central Asia. The return from Eastern Central Asia to Europe of the descendents of one of these groups during the Early Iron Age was probably the principal cause for the emergence of the Scythians on the historical arena. ?? 2009.},

abstract = {This article presents an agent-based model designed to explore the development of cooperation in hunter-fisher-gatherer societies that face a dilemma of sharing an unpredictable resource that is randomly distributed in space. The model is a stylised abstraction of the Yamana society, which inhabited the channels and islands of the southernmost part of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina-Chile). According to ethnographic sources, the Yamana developed cooperative behaviour supported by an indirect reciprocity mechanism: whenever someone found an extraordinary confluence of resources, such as a beached whale, they would use smoke signals to announce their find, bringing people together to share food and exchange different types of social capital. The model provides insight on how the spatial concentration of beachings and agents' movements in the space can influence cooperation. We conclude that the emergence of informal and dynamic communities that operate as a vigilance network preserves cooperation and makes defection very costly.},

abstract = {Recent excavations at the prehistoric and historic encampment at Mukri, in the foothills of the Dzhungar Mountains of eastern Kazakhstan, challenge the view that it was a small, isolated pastoralist camp situated in an ecologically marginal territory. When viewed as a strategically situated node within a dynamic ecology of pastoralist activity, the site's archaeology reveals shifting patterns of land use and networks of interaction that contributed to socio-political change and material diffusion over millennia. This article draws on the granular archaeological evidence of continuity and change at Mukri to understand how pastoralist societies, in local contexts, resonated broader trends in the documentary history of Inner Eurasia. We highlight the effectiveness of pastoralists' strategies in order to reconsider common paradigms of extensive nomadic migrations and episodic conquest as appropriate explanatory models for Eurasian pastoralists throughout antiquity.},

Archaeobotany and zooarchaeology have been used independently to study ancient agriculture, but there is a dire need for a more comprehensive and holistic approach, one that integrates the two data sets and better represents the reality of food production. Correspondence analysis can be an effective tool for quantitatively integrating regional Bronze and Iron Age plant and animal data spanning Syria and Jordan. Distinct regional patterns of food production and wild resource use are evident. The main variable driving this trend is available moisture. Theoretically, the method outlined here can be applied to any region and time period.},

The author succinctly illustrates the features that most clear- ly show the development of a society with powerful central institutions exercising a very strong inter- ference in the local staple economy and control over a substantial portion of the labour force. This de- velopmental process is analysed in an attempt to identify similarities with and differences from the Mesopotamian world, stressing how far the centralisation phenomenon at Arslantepe had basically lo- cal roots, while certainly being parallel to and related with similar developments taking place in the neighbouring southernmost societies},

abstract = {Sixteen Y-chromosomal microsatellites and 16 binary markers have been used to analyze DNA variation in 408 male subjects from 15 populations in Central Asia. Large genetic differences were found between populations, but these did not display an obvious geographical or linguistic pattern like that usually seen for Y-chromosomal variation. Nevertheless, an underlying east-west clinal pattern could be detected by the Autocorrelation Index for DNA Analysis and admixture analysis, and this pattern was interpreted as being derived from the ancient peopling of the area, reinforced by subsequent migrations. Two particularly striking features were seen: an extremely high level of Y-chromosomal differentiation between geographically close populations, accompanied by low diversity within some populations. These were due to the presence of high-frequency population-specific lineages and suggested the occurrence of several recent bottlenecks or founder events. Such events could account for the lack of a clear overall pattern and emphasize the importance of multiple recent events in reshaping this genetic landscape.},

By so doing, it also intends to introduce and contextualise the information presented on individual aspects in the other papers in the same section of this vol-ume. The author stresses the far-reaching changes occurred in the site after the Late Chalcolithic 5 crisis, with successive, sometimes abrupt interruptions in the continuity of the cultural, organisa-tional and socio-economic development of the Arslantepe society, as well as in the site's external re-lations. Two main breaks have been recognised: the first around 3000 BC, after the collapse of the Late Uruk centralised system, and the second around 2700 BC, at the transition between Early Bronze I and II, when Arslantepe and the Malatya region underwent radical changes, bringing toa kind of isolation and then to a new position in the network of interregional political and cultur-al relations.},

Under prevailing conditions, mobile herding is the only sustainable way the population can make best use of the natural resources, but systems were dislocated by collectivization. In the Himalaya there is conflict between herders and sedentary groups. While poor pasture condition is a major constraint, the main problems are socio-economic and institutional and relate to land tenure and grazing rights. Fodder crops are, however, of great interest for settled groups who use the same pastures. Focus on technical solutions, herder training and participatory approaches should be within the context of political decisions.},

abstract = {The multidisciplinary international research project ‘‘Ancient Kura'' aims at the diachronic reconstruction of human-landscape interaction in the southern Caucasus from the begin of sedentism to the Early Bronze Age. It combines research in three areas around the archaeological sites of Aruchlo in Georgia, Mentesh Tepe in western and Kamiltepe in southern Azerbaijan with comparative research concerning environment, archaeological landscapes, bio-archaeology and material culture. The article presents an interim report of the whole project, with chapters by authors on their individual, specialized studies. One of the main foci is on the Neolithic period, which is represented in all three research areas. The Neolithic shows two distinct regional traditions, known as S˘ulaveri-S˘omutepe in the northwestern and as Mil Steppe Painted Ware in the southern area, which reflect different cultural affiliations in these neighboring regions. The Chalcolithic is investigated in great detail at Mentesh Tepe and has also been touched upon in the Kamiltepe region. The Early Bronze Age is represented through burials and pits at Mentesh Tepe. The diachronic and supra-regional comparative approach adopted by the project provides a new perspective concerning specific adaptations within variable habitats reflected in the faunal and botanical record, ranging from temperate to arid climatic zones. Individual sites show differing degrees of integration into regional raw material procurement systems that crosscut and overlie the cultural affiliations.},

abstract = {Evidence from archaeological excavation, intensive surface survey, geoarchaeological investigations, and remote sensing conducted in fall 2002 establishes parameters for the long-term history of human-environment interaction on the eastern margins of the Upper Khuzestan plains. During the 6th-4th millennia ВСЕ (the Susiana and Protoliterate periods), human settlement in this region was dispersed, intermittent, and shifting, due in part to a subsistence economy based on opportunistic floodwater farming and small-scale sheep and goat herding. Dense settled occupation of the region began only in the later 2nd millennium ВСЕ (during the Middle Elamite period), though little is yet known about land use practices at this time. By the early 1st millennium CE, large-scale canal irrigation is already well developed on the plains and has significantly altered their morphology. Observations along the modern Gargar River reveal its origin as an artificial canal, confirming the testimony of 10th century geographers. Archaeological and historical evidence supports reconstruction of the function and history of this channel and assessment of its effects on the agricultural potential of its catchment and on the accumulation and preservation of archaeological deposits.},

abstract = {Despite the growing understanding of the global climate change, great uncertainties exist in the prediction of responses of arid regions to global and regional, natural and human-induced climate change. Meteorological data series show a steady increase of annual and winter temperatures in Central Asia since the beginning of the 20th century that might have a strong potential impact on the region's natural ecosystems, agricultural crops, and human health. Analyses of the NOAA AVHRR temporal series since the 1980s showed a decrease in aridity from 1991-2000 compared to 1982-1990. While most climate models agree that the temperature in arid Central Asia will increase by 1-2??C by 2030-2050, precipitation projections vary from one model to another and projected changes in the aridity index for different model runs show no consistent trend for this region. Local and regional human impacts in arid zones can significantly modify surface albedo, as well as water exchange and nutrient cycles that could have impacts on the climatic system both at the regional and global scales. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Rosen2000,
abstract = {A detailed geoarchaeological and environmental study of southeastern Kazakhstan reveals subtle changes of land use and environment during the Iron Age. Major economic changes from pastoralism to agriculture over time may be reinterpreted from these new findings. With the archaeological, environmental and agricultural information we can suggest a scenario for Saka-Wusun settlement and economy. In the Early Iron Age, Saka tribes moved into the area from the north (Yablonski 1995b) at a time corresponding to a cool-moist Subboreal period. The first settlers at Tuzusai has an agro-pastoral economy in which animals were grazed at least part of the year on the panicoid steppe grasses to the north of Tuzusai, and agriculture was characterized by a dominance of millet. Due to a short growth period, millet is favoured by semi-sedentary pastoralists because the crop can be planted and harvested while maintaining a semi-sedimentary seasonal round. This is especially significant given the short length of the summer growing season and increase in frost-days during the Subboreal period. Millet would have been better adapted to this environmental regime than wheat. In the vicinity of Tuzusai the early Iron Age landscape was an actively aggrading alluvial fan. The alluvial silt originating from the outwash of extended alpine glaciers would have provided a rich agricultural environment with high water tables, aggrading streams, and fresh silts deposited in moist fields each spring. The middle and later phases of occupation at Tuzusai coincided with the onset of the warmer Subatlantic period. The agricultural growing season would have been longer than that of the preceding Subboreal phase. There was a cessation of alluviation on the fan, a stability in the landscape and the beginning of soil formation as indicated by Soil 2. Historically, it was an interval in which Wusun peoples increased their presence in the region due to political and economic pressure from newly consolidating tribes of the Xiongnu to the east and alliances with the Yueh Chih to the west (Enoki et al. 1994; Zadneprovskiy 1994: Ishjamts 1994). There were elite segments which commanded large armies (Ishjamts 1994) and it follows that they would find it necessary to have some measure of control over agricultural production and surplus. The emergence of complex nomadic confederacies might have provided the 'push' factor leading to the intensification of the agricultural sector at the same time that environmental amelioration offered a 'pull' factor. The phytolith remains from Tuzusai appear to represent a small but significant shift from a more pastoral orientation to a more intensive agricultural focus, aided by both environmental and historical factors.},

Ecotopes (ecological patches) provide vital resources for the herding systems used in Central Asia today as well as in the past. We document and discuss wild seed composition of archaeobotanical samples from the Bronze and Iron Age site of Begash in southeastern Kazakhstan noting that much of the archaeobotanical assemblage represents carbonized animal dung, which is currently and historically used as fuel in this region by mobile pastoralists. The seeds offer a window into prehistoric herding patterns and provide a nuanced view of prehistoric land use, social interaction, and community formation across discrete ecological nodes in the Bronze and Iron Ages.},

abstract = {Ten case studies from seven major pastoral regions across six continents were studied in this paper by conceptualizing three factors (agro-ecosystem resilience, livelihood options, and institution capacity) as the axes of a three-dimensional vulnerability framework. This analysis highlights the vulnerability of agriculture-based livelihood systems to global changes and helps identify what institutions have the potential to mobilize effective relief in different pastoral regions. In terms of results, this vulnerability assessment shows that the vulnerability of pastoralism was very different in all the cases across the globe. As such, a further analysis, based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) model was undertaken to enhance our understanding of the ways that global changes put pressures on pastoral livelihoods worldwide. From this we conclude that climate change and climate variability are driving fragile pastoral ecosystems into more vulnerable conditions. Socioeconomic factors, such as changes in land tenure, agriculture, sedentarization, and institutions are fracturing large-scale pastoral ecosystems into spatially isolated systems. The implications of this analysis are that professionals, practitioners, and policy makers should jointly develop a coupled human and natural systems approach that focuses on enhancing the resilience of pastoral communities and their practices. This requires institutional developments to support asset building and good governance to enhance adaptive capability. In addition, pastoralists' adaptation strategies to global change need to be supported by public awareness and improved by institutional decisions at different scales and dimensions. Key},

abstract = {Measurements of 220 male Neolithic and Bronze Age cranial series from Eurasia were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis. The results support the idea that people associated with the Catacomb culture played a major role in the origin of the Afanasyev culture. Okunev people of the Minusinsk Basin, those associated with Karakol, Ust- Tartas, and Krotovo cultures, and those buried in the Andronov-type cemeteries at Cherno-ozerye and Yelovka were of predominantly local Siberian origin. The Samus series resembles that from Poltavka burials. The Okunev people of Tuva and probably Yelunino people were likely descendants of the Pit Grave (Yamnaya) and early Catacomb populations of the Ukraine. The same is true of the Alakul people of western Kazakhstan, who in addition, have numerous affinities amongst Neolithic and Early Bronze Age groups of Central and Western Europe. The probable ancestors of certain Fedorov populations were the Afanasyev tribes of the Altai, whereas other Fedorov groups apparently descended from late Pit Grave and Catacomb tribes of the Northern Caucasus and the northwestern Caspian. People of Gumugou are closest to Fedorov groups of northeastern Kazakhstan and Rudny Altai, suggesting that Caucasoids migrated to Xinjiang from the north rather than from the west. Describing the gracile Caucasoids of Siberia and Eastern Central Asia as "Mediterraneans" is misleading since they display virtually no craniometric ties with the Near Eastern, Southwestern Central Asian or Transcaucasian groups. The totality of evidence suggests that they were Nordics. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Historically, pastoral people were able to more freely use the services their semi-arid and arid ecosystems provide, and they adapted to changes in ways that improved their well-being. More recently, their ability to adapt has been constrained due to changes from within and from outside their communities. To compare possible responses by pastoral communities, we modeled ecosystem services and tied those services to decisions that people make at the household level. We created an agent-based household model called DECUMA, joined that model with the ecosystem model SAVANNA, and applied the linked models to southeastern Kajiado District, Kenya. The structure of the new agent-based model and linkages between the models are described, and then we demonstrate the model results using a scenario that shows changes in Maasai well-being in response to drought. We then explore two additional but related scenarios, quantifying household well-being if access to a grazing reserve is lost and if access is lost but those most affected are compensated. In the second scenario, households in group ranches abutting the grazing reserve that lost access had large declines in livestock populations, less food energy from animal sources, increased livestock sales and grain purchases, and increased need for supplemental foods. Households in more distant areas showed no changes or had increases in livestock populations because their herds had fewer animals with which to compete for forage. When households neighboring the grazing reserve were compensated for the lease of the lands they had used, they prospered. We describe some benefits and limitations of the agent-based approach.},

It has been argued that the initial development of pastoralism in the Central Zagros Mountains should be viewed as an adap- tive strategy to a highland environment with limited and dispersed resources in order to supplement a primarily agricultural village-based economy.With expansion of the agricultural regime, the distance to be traveled to pastures by herders became greater, and as a consequence, the organization of labor involved in herding had to be modified to meet the more complex task ofmov- ing sizable herds over larger areas. The empirical evidence for the assessment of hypotheses proposed in this paper comes from archaeological fieldwork in the Islamabad Plain in the Zagros Mountains in western Iran, as well as previous archaeological and ethnographic research in the region.},

abstract = {This paper highlights a spatial interaction entropy maximization (SIEM) model to reproduce and understand past human settlement hierarchy in Central Anatolia (CA) and the Khabur Triangle (KT) during the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000–1600 BC). We propose applying SIEM to understand which sites and areas would have become prominent in this period by using known archaeological sites as point data and textual evidence for calibration purposes. The model addresses to which extent general factors such as topography, transportation, or social–ecological advantages (e.g., environmental benefits, external contacts, religion) make locations attractive for trade and settlement and why some archaeological sites become more prominent than others in the period discussed. The modelling results have been checked against the observed data from archaeological survey carried out in the KT and CA in order to explain the best fits. The results show that geography and topography can explain the growth of some main urban centres. In other cases, settlement hierarchies are generally explained by different initial advantages (endogenous or exogenous) for each site. Similar patterns are evident in CA and the KT, where movement constraint is due to political landscapes fragmented into numerous competing polities. In the KT, movement is slightly more restricted than CA, suggesting that warfare intensity is higher in open plains than in hilly and mountainous landscapes. Furthermore, SIEM is demonstrated to be useful in characterizing areas of interactions on different spatial scales in CA and the KT. Overall, the results demonstrate the advantage of SIEM model to enable researchers to account for missing empirical data, to compare settlement and interaction dynamics in different regions and to explain which underlying factors are beyond the reproducible observed patterns.},

@article{Mace1989,
abstract = {We present a general model of a camel and small stock, nomadic pastoral system. The model addresses the question of how household wealth should be divided between camels and small stock in order to maximise the long term viability of the household in an environment where rainfall is unpredictable. The modelling technique used is stochastic dynamic programming. The model shows that the optimal ratio of camels to small stock depends on total household wealth. In general, poor households should only invest in small stock. Once herd size is above a critical limit, the household should then invest most of its wealth in camels. This critical herd size depends, mainly, on the subsistence requirement of the household. Once investing in camels, the number of small stock kept depends mainly on the variability of small stock herd growth rate and on their price relative to camels. The importance of changing strategy according to wealth is illustrated by comparing the long term survival chances of households following the optimal policy with households following two other simple strategies which do not depend on wealth. The strategy with the highest mean productivity of the three in the short term is the least successful in the long term. This shows the vital importance of incorporating risk of drought when modelling these systems. This is an advance on previous models of pastoral systems as it enables relevant stochastic processes, and the herders' responses, to be taken into account. This has practical application as the expected long term viability of households, and the possible effects on that viability of particular events, such as a donation of stock or food aid, can be estimated. ?? 1989.},

The extent of this distribution is daunting, and as a result, the research focuses on the western portion of the ETC distribution zone, and more specifically on the Malatya-Elazıg region of Eastern Turkey, the Amuq Valley of Southeastern Anatolia, and Northern Palestine. This dissertation places the history of the interpretation of ETC wares within the context of the history of anthropological thought in an effort to contextualize the question. Primary data, drawn from the Amuq Valley Regional Project (AVRP) Survey, is used for an in-depth GIS analysis of settlement patterns. The AVRP Survey collections are also used to form a new regional EBA typology for an examination of the ceramic industries of the EBA in the Amuq Valley. These new data are then compared with the material from regions to the north and south of the Amuq, to evaluate traditional explanatory mechanisms and to understand the distribution of ETC wares as a result of a migration. Finally, a reconstruction that would best explain the data is created to complete the understanding of the distribution of the related wares across the greater Near East.},

This research contributes an important comparative perspective on processes of complex sociopolitical organization practiced among mobile groups. This essay employs a novel approach to understanding the organizational techniques and methods of finance that supported large-scale imperial polities of eastern Eurasia, specifically those centered on the Mongolian steppe. Using full-coverage survey data from the northern Mongolian valley of Egiin Gol, we present the results of diachronic spatial and environmental analyses in order to evaluate current models for nomadic political economy. We argue that eastern Eurasian subsistence economics are best understood not as a single "type" of production but as a productive process based on multiresource capacities (agro-pastoral, hunting, gathering, fishing) and the flexibility to readily adjust resource emphasis, degree of mobility, and specialization relative to a changeable environment. We offer a revised model for eastern steppe political integration emphasizing the spatial management of political relationships within a mobile setting. Our essay concludes with a brief overview of the potential for Eurasian steppe archaeology to contribute novel comparative insights for anthropologists studying the diversities and commonalities of complex social organization.},

abstract = {Survey archaeology can contribute a unique perspective to the history of mobile pastoralism by investigating local pastoral landscapes-the organization of resources and features immediately surrounding a campsite. This paper examines empirical evidence for mobile pastoralists' modes of inhabiting and transforming local landscape over the last 600-700. years on the edges of the Upper Tigris River Valley, southeastern Turkey. Multispectral satellite imagery analysis is employed to spatially relate vegetation patterns and archaeological features connected with herding. Statistical analysis of cost distance rasters enables quantitative spatial analysis of feature distribution in the landscape. Three main conclusions about pre-modern mobile pastoralists are drawn: (1) Mobile pastoralists altered their local landscapes in order to shelter humans and animals, collect water, and improve fragmented pastures of variable quality. (2) Pasture and water features were fixed, re-usable investments that encouraged seasonal re-inhabitation. Over time, these features became landscape anchors-geographic foci that structured the spatial organization of local landscapes. (3) The topographical position of domestic and herding features would have resulted in vertical daily movement patterns for humans and animals. The study represents a first step in reconstructing mobile pastoralists' dwelling spaces and pre-modern land-use strategies on the fringes of Mesopotamia. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Scholars have usually focused on the complex and diverse questions that resulted from the analysis of the historical realities of this key region during Antiquity. The purpose of this book is to undertake an approach to the polymorphic and multiple aspects of Central Asia in Antiquity from several points of view. The starting point is the confidence in an interdisciplinary perspective as the main way to understand the different aspects of the region in a very wide chronology: from the emergence of the cities and their relation with the nomadic populations, to the expansion of models and practices from Central Asia to the West during the campaigns and conquests led by Islam. Through subjects like warfare, gender studies and historiography, mainly from an archaeological point of view, the chapters analyze concrete sites like Mes Aynak, Uch Kulakh or Vardanzeh, but also models of interaction among the historical peoples living in Asia Central, like the Bactrians and the Persians, the Persians and Macedonians, the Greeks and the Indians, the Sassanid and the Romans, or even the Sassanid and the Steppe peoples. The result is a very clear example of the richness of starting an interdisciplinary dialogue with the intention of improving our perspectives and understandings of the complex relationships that, through Antiquity, the people living in Central Asia had developed and how scholars can, through archaeology and other related disciplines, approach the historical questions that arise in a close study of the subjects.},

abstract = {The appearance of the Early Transcaucasian Culture (ETC) across large portions of the Near East in the 3rd millennium BC is commonly cited as one of the best archaeologically documented and broadly studied cases of a prehistoric migration. This study uses the ETC to develop a model of what happens when migrants move into regions that are already inhabited by emerging or complex societies. In particular, this study focuses on how immigrant populations can integrate themselves into indigenous communities in a physical, socio-political and economic sense, and how a migrant group's identity can be constructed and maintained alongside these indigenous communities.Multiple lines of evidence, including settlement patterns, ceramic evidence and textual records, are used to postulate an economic niche for the ETC in viti- and viniculture, which has a long recorded history in Transcaucasia, commonly regarded as the place of origin of the ETC. The production of a consumable high status commodity such as wine by ETC immigrants provided them with the socioeconomic status that allowed them to maintain their social identity in an archaeologically visible manner in their new homelands for extended periods of time. Furthermore, the increased production of wine provided by the immigrants eventually changes the availability of this commodity and transforming its use and transforms its consumption in North Syrian societies.},

abstract = {Conflicts associated with natural resource use are common in rural areas of Africa. Political ecology's analytical and methodological foci on these conflicts is shared by other quite different schools of thought that strongly influence policies on environment and development. The influential “environmental security” and “common property management” perspectives generally conceptualize resource-related conflicts as scarcity-driven while political ecologists have made major contributions toward more multidimensional, complex views about the genesis of resource-related conflict. This paper explores two moral dimensions of resource conflict. First, it continues the tradition within political ecology of questioning popular notions of resource conflict. It does so by analyzing farmer–herder conflict in the Sahel—a type of resource-related conflict that seemingly fits the view that conflict is generated from increased competition over a dwindling pool of resources. By seriously engaging with the materiality of agropastoral production, this paper illuminates the complex relationships between political interests, moralities, and resource access that underlie these conflicts. Second, this paper considers the ethics of how we portray resource conflict. In the present policy context in Africa, overly-simplistic treatments of resource conflict by political ecologists or others may unintentionally support programs that are likely to negatively impact the human subjects of research, conservation or development.},

This trait combination evidences affi nities with the peoples of southern Turkmenistan, northern Tadzhikistan, and central Iran. Somewhat less common is a gracile variant with a low vault, narrow, low face - a trait complex displayed by the peoples of Namazga, Sapallitepa, Zaman-baba, and the Chust cultures of Western Central Asia and of the Turing-Hissar culture of northeastern Iran. The combination of robustness, dolichocrany, high, broad face, typical of the pastoralist tribes of the Bishkent culture of southern Tadzhikistan does not occur in the Pamirs. Markedly Caucasoid features along with a very low cranial index points to Near Eastern, Middle Eastern, and South Asian affi nities. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {Numerous Bronze Age cemeteries in the oases surrounding the T{\"{a}}klamakan Desert of the Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, western China, have yielded both mummified and skeletal human remains. A dearth of local antecedents, coupled with woolen textiles and the apparent Western physical appearance of the population, raised questions as to where these people came from. Two hypotheses have been offered by archaeologists to account for the origins of Bronze Age populations of the Tarim Basin. These are the "steppe hypothesis" and the "Bactrian oasis hypothesis." Eight craniometric variables from 25 Aeneolithic and Bronze Age samples, comprising 1,353 adults from the Tarim Basin, the Russo-Kazakh steppe, southern China, Central Asia, Iran, and the Indus Valley, are compared to test which, if either, of these hypotheses are supported by the pattern of phenetic affinities possessed by Bronze Age inhabitants of the Tarim Basin. Craniometric differences between samples are compared with Mahalanobis generalized distance (d2), and patterns of phenetic affinity are assessed with two types of cluster analysis (the weighted pair average linkage method and the neighbor-joining method), multidimensional scaling, and principal coordinates analysis. Results obtained by this analysis provide little support for either the steppe hypothesis or the Bactrian oasis hypothesis. Rather, the pattern of phenetic affinities manifested by Bronze Age inhabitants of the Tarim Basin suggests the presence of a population of unknown origin within the Tarim Basin during the early Bronze Age. After 1200 B.C., this population experienced significant gene flow from highland populations of the Pamirs and Ferghana Valley. These highland populations may include those who later became known as the Saka and who may have served as "middlemen" facilitating contacts between East (Tarim Basin, China) and West (Bactria, Uzbekistan) along what later became known as the Great Silk Road.},

abstract = {Theories of migration hold a pervasive position in prehistoric archaeology of Central Eurasia. International research on Eurasia today reflects the juxtaposition of archaeological theory and practice from distinct epistemological traditions, and migration is at the crux of current debates. Migration was employed paradigmatically during the Soviet era to explain the geography and materiality of prehistoric ethnogenesis, whereas in the west it was harshly criticized in prehistoric applications, especially in the 1970s. Since the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), migration has resurfaced as an important, yet polemical, explanation in both academic arenas. Short- and long-distance population movements are seen as fundamental mechanisms for the formation and distribution of regional archaeological cultures from the Paleolithic to historical periods and as a primary social response to environmental, demographic, and political pressures. Critics view the archaeological record of Eurasia as a product of complex local and regional interaction, exchange, and innovation, reinvigorating essential debates around migration, diffusion, and autochthonous change in Eurasian prehistory.},

abstract = {In this article I present a new archaeological synthesis concerning the earliest formation of mobile pastoralist economies across central Eurasia. I argue that Eurasian steppe pastoralism developed along distinct local trajectories in the western, central, and (south)eastern steppe, sparking the development of regional networks of interaction in the late fourth and third millennia BC. The “Inner Asian Mountain Corridor” exemplifies the relationship between such incipient regional networks and the process of economic change in the eastern steppe territory. The diverse regional innovations, tech- nologies, and ideologies evident across Eurasia in the mid-third millennium BC are cast as the building blocks of a unique political economy shaped by “nonuniform” institutional alignments among steppe populations throughout the second millennium BC. This theoretical model illustrates how regional channels of interaction between distinct societies positioned Eurasian mobile pastoralists as key players in wide-scale institutional developments among traditionally conceived “core” civili- zations while also enabling them to remain strategically independent and small-scale in terms of their own sociopolitical organization. The development of nonuniform institutional complexity among Eurasian pastoralists demonstrates a unique political and economic structure applicable to societies whose variable political and territorial scales are inconsistent with commonly understood evolutionary or corporate sociopolitical typologies such as chiefdoms, states, or empires},

A particular emphasis is placed on issues that are crucial to regional studies in the steppe ecological zone; however, it is also suggested that steppe prehistory must come to play a more significant role in developing more comprehensive understandings of world prehistory. Key developments connected with the steppe include the diffusion of anatomically modern humans, horse domestication, spoke-wheeled chariot and cavalry warfare, early metal production and trade, Indo-European languages, and the rise of nomadic states and empires. In addition to these important issues, thoughts are offered on some of the current challenges that face archaeological scholarship in this region of the world.},

abstract = {This article examines the effect of climate change on a type of armed conflict that pits pastoralists (cattle herders) against each other (range wars). Such conflicts are typically fought over water rights and/or grazing rights to unfenced/unowned land. The state is rarely involved directly. The rangeland of East Africa is a region particularly vulnerable to drought and livestock diseases associated with climate change. To analyze the possible effects of climate change on pastoral conflict, we focus our analysis on changes in resource availability, contrasting cases of abundance and scarcity. The role of resources is further contextualized by competing notions of property rights, and the role of the state in defining property and associated rights. We employ a contest success function (CSF) game-theoretic model to analyze the logic of range wars. This CSF approach emphasizes the low-level, non-binary nature of raiding behavior between pastoralist groups over limited natural resources. A central contribution of this approach is that the logic of raiding behavior implies a positive relationship between resources and conflict. This positive relationship is supported by several studies of the rangeland of East Africa, but is generally dismissed by the literature on the resource curse'. This relationship is contingent on other factors examined in the model, producing the following results. First, the level of property rights protection provided by the state generally reduces conflict between pastoralist groups. Second, if property rights protection is provided in a biased manner, then conflict between pastoralist groups increases. Third, severe resource asymmetries between two pastoralist groups will induce the poorer group to become bandits (focusing their efforts on raiding and not producing), while the richer group raids in retaliation.},

@article{Hemphill1999a,
abstract = {Discovery of a previously unknown Bronze Age civilization (Oxus civilization) centered on the oases of Central Asia revealed the presence of large, preplanned urban centers immediately above sterile soil. Given the absence of local antecedents, the sudden appearance and proliferation of these Oxus civilization urban centers in the oases of Bactria and Margiana immediately raised the issue of where the inhabitants of these urban centers came from. Three hypotheses have been offered by archaeologists to account for the origins of Oxus civilization populations. These include the early influence model, the late colonization model, and the trichotomy model. Eleven craniometric variables from 12 Aeneolithic and Bronze Age samples, encompassing 657 adults from Central Asia, Iran, and the Indus Valley, are compared to test which if any of these hypotheses are supported by the pattern of phenetic affinities possessed by the Oxus civilization inhabitants of the north Bactrian oasis. Craniometric differences between samples are compared with Mahalanobis generalized distance (d2), and patterns of phenetic affinity are assessed with two types of cluster analysis (WPGMA, neighbor-joining method), multidimensional scaling, and principal coordinates analysis. Results of this analysis provide no support for either the late colonization model or the trichotomy model but do offer some support for the early influence model. Nevertheless, it is clear that the early influence model fails to account for a shift in interregional contacts, perhaps from western China to the north around 2000 BC, that appears to have played a major role in the origins of the Oxus civilization inhabitants of the north Bactrian oasis.},

abstract = {Provides an overall view of, and original insights into, the economics of land and resources in the Roman world; * Features a range of different methodologies and theoretical perspectives; * Relevant to the economic history of medieval and early modern Europe, and therefore appeals to a wide scholarly audience of historians and economists. Explanation of the success and failure of the Roman economy is one of the most important problems in economic history. As an economic system capable of sustaining high production and consumption levels, it was unparalleled until the early modern period. This volume focuses on how the institutional structure of the Roman Empire affected economic performance both positively and negatively. An international range of contributors offers a variety of approaches that together enhance our understanding of how different ownership rights and various modes of organization and exploitation facilitated or prevented the use of land and natural resources in the production process. Relying on a large array of resources - literary, legal, epigraphic, papyrological, numismatic, and archaeological - chapters address key questions regarding the foundations of the Roman Empire's economic system. Questions of growth, concentration and legal status of property (private, public, or imperial), the role of the state, content and limitations of rights of ownership, water rights and management, exploitation of indigenous populations, and many more receive new and original analyses that make this book a significant step forward to understanding what made the economic achievements of the Roman empire possible. Readership: Scholars and students interested in the ancient Roman economy and the institutional structure of the Roman Empire, in particular the role played by land and resources, as well as classical studies, economic history, and classical archaeology.},

abstract = {Abstract. Agriculture began in the eastern Mediterranean Levantine Corridor about 11000 years ago toward the end of the Younger Dryas when aridity had diminished wild food resources. During the subsequent Climatic Optimum, agricultural villages spread rapidly but subsequent climatic changes on centennial to millennial scales resulted in striking oscillations in settlement, especially in marginal areas. Natural climate change thus alternately enhanced and diminished the agricultural potential of the land. Growing populations and more intensive land us, both for agriculture and livestock, have led to changes in the structure of vegetation, hydrology, and land quality. Over the millennia, political and economic interventions, warfare and incursions by nomadic herding tribes all impacted sustainability of agriculture and the ability of the land to supports its populations. In much of the region today, agricultural land use is not sustainable given existing technology and national priorities. The Near Eastern case is instructive because of the quality of information, the length of the record, and the pace of modern change.},

No pretense is made of the accuracy of this provisional formulation. Nomadism is a case where regularities are particularly evident, how-ever. Some of the regularities apply to other types of societies or subsistence modes, so some care will be taken as to the level of generality of some of the principles for-mulated. To engage in this level of theorizing about empirical cases, graph theoretic concepts of network segregation and cohesion provide measures that are usefully related to issues of the emergence, transformation and decay of social and economic networks and their sustainability and resilience in relation to the environment and the organization of energy, material, social, and informational flows. Segregation tells us, for example, how elements of a network divide into parts and cohesion is a more complicated concept that helps us understand generically how parts of a network pull together into emergent blocks that have higher degrees of resilience and internalized processes.},

abstract = {We explore settlement structures and hierarchy found in different archaeological periods in northern, specifically the Khabur Triangle (KT), and southern Mesopotamia (SM) using a spatial interaction entropy maximization (SIEM) modeling and simulation method. Regional settlement patterns are investigated in order to understand what feedback levels for settlement benefits, or incentives, and abilities to move or disperse between sites in a landscape and period could have enabled observed settlement structures to emerge or be maintained. Archaeological and historical data are then used to interpret the best results. We suggest that in the Late Chalcolithic (LC) and first half of the Early Bronze Age (EBA), the KT and SM appear to have comparable urban patterns and development, where settlement advantage feedbacks and movement are similarly shaping the two regions for those periods. Within period variations, such as restrictions to population diffusion or movement in the EBA, are possible. In the KT during the Middle Bronze Age (MBA), multiple centers begin to emerge, suggesting a lack of social cohesion and/or political fragmentation. This is similar to SM in the MBA, but we also see the emergence of a single, dominant site. In the Iron Age (IA), movement in the KT likely becomes the least constrained in all assessed periods, as socio-political cohesion facilitates this process, with small sites now the norm and dominance by one state over the region is evident. For the same period in SM, a single site (Babylon) obtains significant settlement advantages relative to its neighbors and easy movement enables it to become far larger in size and likely socially, economically, and politically dominant. Overall, the results demonstrate that the method is useful for archaeologists and social theorists in allowing them to compare different archaeological survey results, with varied spatial dimensions and diachronically, while providing a level of explanation that addresses empirical settlement patterns observed.},

abstract = {This thesis undertakes a complete reinvestigation of the archaeology of a large Early Bronze Age cemetery at İkiztepe in northern Turkey, by utilizing oxygen and strontium isotope analysis of human remains in combination with spatial and biodistance analysis and various dating techniques to identify potential immigrants to the site and to examine larger issues of residential mobility and social organization. The occupation of the Northern Anatolian site of İkiztepe is traditionally assigned to the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Ages. However, the site's chronological framework has been challenged in recent years. These chronological issues have been addressed by applying fluoride and AMS radiocarbon dating to the skeletal remains from the İkiztepe cemetery, to develop an absolute and relative chronology for the burials. These results have shown that the cemetery dates at least a millennium earlier than previously supposed. Oxygen and strontium isotope analyses allowed the identification of individuals whose bone chemistry suggests that they were possible long distance immigrants to the site of İkiztepe, as well as suggesting the existence of a group of mobile individuals who may represent a transhumant segment of the İkiztepe population. Spatial and biodistance analyses suggest that principles of cemetery organization in this period were highly complex. Immigrant individuals and nomadic or semi-nomadic segments of the population do not appear to have been distinguished in any observable way from their sedentary local counterparts, displaying similar burial types, grave goods and spatial locations. Furthermore, burial within the İkiztepe cemetery does not appear to have been kin structured. These results suggest that assumptions about funerary practices as important indicators of cultural identity and lineage affiliation may represent an over-simplification of complex patterns of interaction and integration among and within populations and cultural groups.},

Present trends are leading to greater restrictions on livestock husbandry and a growing convergence of livelihood practices among groups whose identities are tied to herding and farming. Using the cases of four rural communities in Niger, this study adopts an ‘access to resources' framework to analyse the causal connections among: rural peoples' livelihood strategies, everyday social relations of production, perceptions of social groups' identities, and the potential for farmer–herder conflict. While the convergence of livelihoods arguably increases the frequency of conflict triggers, it has also, through the expansion of shared common interests and cross-group, production-related relationships, improved the ability of communities to effectively manage these incipient conflicts.},

abstract = {In the third millennium B.C., the Longshan culture in the Central Plains of northern China was the crucial matrix in which the first states evolved from the basis of earlier Neolithic societies. By adopting the theoretical concept of the chiefdom and by employing the methods of settlement archaeology, especially regional settlement hierarchy and rank-size analysis, this paper introduces a new approach to research on the Longshan culture and to inquiring about the development of the early states in China. Three models of regional settlement pattern correlating to different types of chiefdom systems are identified. These are: (1) the centripetal regional system in circumscribed regions representing the most complex chiefdom organizations, (2) the centrifugal regional system in semi-circumscribed regions indicating less integrated chiefdom organization, and (3) the decentralized regional system in noncircumscribed regions implying competing and the least complex chiefdom organizations. Both external and internal factors, including geographical condition, climatic fluctuation, Yellow River's changing course, population movement, and intergroup conflict, played important roles in the development of complex societies in the Longshan culture. As in many cultures in other parts of the world, the early states in China emerged from a system of competing chiefdoms, which was characterized by intensive intergroup conflict and frequent shifting of political centers. However, what is unusual about the Chinese case is the fact that the earliest states did not develop from the most complex of the chiefdom organizations, but from the least complex chiefdom systems then existing there.},

In particular it focuses on the challenges to development as well as the risk conflict presents to domestic and international security.A new generation of emerging pastoral projects share many common characteristics. They:acknowledge pastoralists as capable environmental custodians and managersallow for patterns of mobility and livelihood diversificationinclude the systematic participation of pastoral communitiesenhance access to and options for extended information and communicationimprove representation of pastoral interests vis-{\`{a}}-vis external agents (other land users, government bodies, market agents, civil society, etc.)stress the development of pastoral markets.The reduction of conflict should be a high priority for international development in pastoral regions. The failure to tackle the root causes of pastoral violence is constraining development across much of the global south. Key to mitigating these conflicts is to recognise that pastoral livelihoods are a fundamental element of rural economies, and to find ways to integrate them into the formal economy while strengthening the capacity of these communities to adapt to changing environmental and social conditions.},

After a brief discussion of some general aspects of pastoral nomadism that have particular relevance for the archaeologist, three problems in the archaeology of India are considered. Although unrelated, each problem in its way admits of a pastoral nomad interpretation. The first is the familiar one of the Aryans, who, it is suggested, are likely initially to have used the products of indigenous craftsmen and for this very reason their identification has proven so elusive. The next section seeks to identify certain microlith-users whose connection with domestic animals is assured, with a nomadic adaptation recognizable in the last centuries B.C. The final section discusses the character of an important South Indian grave complex. Its specific Iranian traits and an artefactual assemblage in which horse equipment and weapons are prominent, again seem best explained by reference to the movements of pastoral nomads.},

abstract = {Social and environmental factors affecting land use change are among the most significant drivers transforming the planet. Such change has been and continues to be monitored through the use of satellite imagery, aerial photography, and technical reports. While these monitoring tools are useful in observing the empirical results of land use change and issues of sustainability, the data they provide are often not useful in capturing the fundamental policies, social drivers, and unseen factors that shape how landscapes are transformed. In addition, some monitoring approaches can be prohibitively expensive and too slow in providing useful data at a timescale in which data are needed. This paper argues that techniques using information fusion and conducting assessments of continuous data feeds can be beneficial for monitoring primary social and ecological mechanisms affecting how geographic settings are changed over different time scales. We present a computational approach that couples open source tools in order to conduct an analysis of text data, helping to determine relevant events and trends. To demonstrate the approach, we discuss a case study that integrates varied newspapers from two Midwest states in the United States, Iowa and Nebraska, showing how potentially significant issues and events can be captured. Although the approach we present is useful for monitoring current web-based data streams, we argue that such a method should ultimately be integrated closely with less managed systems and modeling techniques to enhance not only land use monitoring but also to better forecast and understand landscape change.},

abstract = {Domuztepe, in southeastern Turkey, is one of the largest known Late Neolithic sites in the Near East. Ecofactual remains recovered at Domuztepe indicate that the site's inhabitants relied on a well-established mixed economy of domestic plants and animals to sustain the settlement's large population, which may have peaked at more than 1,500 people. Evidence of a long and continuous occupation of this site attests to a successful agropastoral economy, even though Domuztepe was situated at the intersection of uplands, an alluvial plain, and marshy zones, an environment not traditionally considered ideal for agriculture. Integrated faunal and botanical analyses explore the diversity of domestic and wild resources used by the site's inhabitants. The typical suite of Near Eastern domesticates dominates the excavated assemblage, with sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and cereals prominent. In addition to a nutritional role, these food products were used for clothing, storage, and construction and had symbolic importance in ritual and prestige. Combined archaeobiological data point to a seasonal cycle of activities.},

abstract = {The eastern Hindu Kush in northern Pakistan is among the most dynamically active tectonic and geomorphic areas in the world. During the Quaternary, valley-fill sediments of great thickness have been deposited by glacial, fluvial, eolian and mass-movement processes. Fluvial incision eroded these sediments and formed terraces. Their development was controlled by tectonic and climatic factors, and therefore they record information about the Quaternary landscape evolution and glaciations. Investigations included the mapping of landforms, especially the terraces, and sedimentological analyses on valley-fill deposits. This resulted in a classification with six main types of terraces: morainic, glaciofluvial, fluvial, lacustrine, mass-movement debris, and fan terraces. Tectonic terraces were not recognized, but tectonically influenced sediments have been found near the Shyok Suture Zone. This classification corresponds with results from the nearby Karakoram. Two major Late Pleistocene glaciations are recognized during marine isotopic stage 3 (MIS-3) (Drosh Glacial Stage) and in the MIS-2/Early Holocene (Pret Glacial Stage). Moraines from the Neoglacial (Shandur Glacial Stages I and II) and the Little Ice Age (Barum Glacial Stage I) are located near the contemporary glaciers. During deglaciations, huge terraces were formed: the upper terrace or Broz Fan Formation and the middle terrace or Ayun Fan Formation between the Drosh and Pret Glacial Stages, and the lower terrace or Urghuch Fan Formation after the Pret Glacial Stage. The chronology presented in this paper shows that there was only limited glaciation in the eastern Hindu Kush during the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs), perhaps used along with other methods, are increasingly being applied to address problems involving social-ecological systems (SES). However, systematic and standardized techniques for organizing data requirements and collecting information for such models are generally not applied. Defining the types of data that need to be collected is a critical step in instantiating relevant models and detailing behavioral patterns. By organizing data needs into pertinent categories, researchers can focus efforts to make data collection more efficient, provide a clear record of gathered data, conserve project resources, and create models more easily. In this paper, we present a formal method, which we call Delineate, Structure, and Gather (DSG), that has been applied to guide the determination of data requirements, structure data needs, and enable data collection for the development of ABMs addressing SES. The presented framework continues and supplements existing efforts that provide standardization and protocol techniques for constructing ABMs. An active project is presented in order to demonstrate how DSG can be implemented to address SES issues.},

abstract = {The introduction of new technologies into small remote communities can alter how individuals acquire knowledge about their surrounding environment. This is especially true when technologies that satisfy basic needs, such as freshwater use, create a distance (i.e., diminishing exposure) between individuals and their environment. However, such distancing can potentially be countered by the transfer of local knowledge between community members and from one generation to the next. The objective of this study is to simulate by way of agent-based modeling the tensions between technology-induced distancing and local knowledge that are exerted on community vulnerability to climate change. A model is developed that simulates how a collection of individual perceptions about changes to climatic-related variables manifest into community perceptions, how perceptions are influenced by the movement away from traditional resource use, and how the transmission of knowledge mitigates the potentially adverse effects of technology-induced distancing. The model is implemented utilizing climate and social data for two remote communities located on the Seward Peninsula in western Alaska. The agent-based model simulates a set of scenarios that depict different ways in which these communities may potentially engage with their natural resources, utilize knowledge transfer, and develop perceptions of how the local climate is different from previous years. A loosely-coupled pan-arctic climate model simulates changes monthly changes to climatic variables. The discrepancy between the perceptions derived from the agent-based model and the projections simulated by the climate model represent community vulnerability. The results demonstrate how demographics, the communication of knowledge and the types of 'knowledge-providers' influence community perception about changes to their local climate.},

abstract = {Pastoralism, the use of extensive grazing in rangelands for livestock production, is one of the key production systems in the world's drylands. Nonetheless, throughout much of its long history its reputation has been unflattering, its practitioners marginalised by sedentary cultivators and urban dwellers. Pastoral societies have risen and fallen, fragmented into isolated families or constructed world-spanning empires and their demise regularly announced, often in the face of entirely contrary evidence of their persistence. By some paradox, anthropologists and social theorists have conducted a prolonged love affair with pastoralism, at times seeing it as an inevitable stage in the growth of civilization or perversely caricaturing it as an anarchic institution ready to pull down that same civilization. Planners have denigrated the mobility characteristic of pastoral societies and novelists have romanticised the wanderings of these same nomads. Development experts, remarking the enormous passing herds, first saw pastoral systems as rich in potential, and later castigated pastoralists as vulnerable and unable to invest in development. To all this, pastoralists have remained largely indifferent, since a certain scepticism towards the schemes and caprices of the external world is an almost inevitable product of the independent image they have of themselves. The late twentieth century has seen a new upwelling of writing on pastoralism, both sentimental and aggrieved, regretting its inevitable demise and blaming pastoralists for their failure to respond to the vagaries of climate and the international economic system. Investment in pastoral development, which reached a high point in the 1970s, crumbles progressively every year. At the same time, however, pastoralists themselves have become far more articulate and able to communicate their concerns and desires to the outer world. The collapse of the Soviet Empire has opened up the great steppes of Central Asia for the first time in seventy years making accessible a whole world of pastoralism that had been essentially closed to researchers since 1919. Indeed, the likely effect has been to expand pastoralism, as refugees from now collapsed industrial enterprises that only functioned with significant subsidy have sought to revive the only method of subsistence that is practical through much of this region. The time seems apposite then, for a view of pastoralism in the world as a whole, combining recent insights from archaeology and anthropology with twentieth century experiences of development. Despite a plethora of case studies, monographs and collected papers on African and Asian pastoral systems, integrated worldwide overviews of pastoralism are surprisingly few. The most recent essay in this direction is probably Khazanov (1984) which approaches pastoralism from a historical point of view, focusing on nomad relations with external societies and the origin of the state. The rich and complex literature on pastoral development is effectively ignored, perhaps unsurprisingly from the point of view of Soviet ethnography. More important, however, is the failure to integrate the biological, to recognise that pastoral society is above all driven by the nature and requirements of different species. This monograph is intended to try and provide a synopsis of the present and draw out the implications for the future.},

abstract = {The multicomponent site of Maski in northern Karnataka has long held a central position in the culture-historic narratives of archaeologists and historians alike. Yet since B.K. Thapar's correlation of archaeological deposits at Maski with Wheeler's culture history sequence in the 1950s, archaeological research at Maski has been largely absent. Our research at Maski has sought to build upon this important chronological foundation, expanding our understanding of late prehistoric social life by asking questions and collecting data that explore the entanglements of settlement, social life, land use and craft production during the South Indian Iron Age and Early Historic Periods. To date we have completed three seasons of archaeological survey in a 64 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} area centered on the site of Maski and recoded 153 sites and numerous concentrations of "off-site" artifacts that are revealing temporally sensitive material patterning from which we can begin to address these objectives. Here we present preliminary patterns for Neolithic (3000-1200 BC), Iron Age (1200-300 BC), Early Historic (300 BC-AD 500), and Medieval (AD 500-1600) period materials in the region. The results of the survey so far have documented significant temporally sensitive changes in the size, location, and distribution of settlement, metal production activities, agro-pastoral land use, and mortuary interments that point towards historical developments in regional land-use and socio-political practices.},

Our new finding is significant because Tuzusai has the first clear evidence for the presence of agriculture from the Iron Age of northern Central Asia. The diversity of crops grown at Tuzusai required varying labor and time inputs and a well-planned scheduling system.},

abstract = {This article draws on archaeological data from Late Bronze Age (LBA, ca. 1550-1150 BC) fortress, shrine, cemetery, and residential sites in Armenia to challenge long-held assumptions about the potential for mobile-pastoral groups to develop and sustain complex polities. The past two decades of research by Project ArAGATS (the Armenian-American collaboration for the Archaeology and Geography of Ancient Transcaucasian Societies) has demonstrated that LBA sovereignty emerged not through the sociopolitical coalescence of settled farming villages, but through the actions of hierarchically organized, mobile pastoralists. Post-processual archaeology helped focus discussions of ancient political life on the contingent nature of authority and the processes through which competing factions and stakeholders achieve political association. However, centuries of interpretive marginalization of nomadic peoples combined with deterministic notions regarding subsistence and settlement practices of mobile pastoralists have, until recently, hindered a broader anthropological consideration of the potential pathways to sovereignty available to more mobile societies. Drawing on a range of datasets from LBA fortresses, shrines, cemeteries, and ephemeral residential complexes, our study examines the essential factors contributing to the emergence and maintenance of complex polities among mobile pastoralists in the southern Caucasus, societies that were intimately associated-politically, economically, and ritually-with hill-top fortresses. This study of political association in LBA Armenia sheds light on the internal politics of nomadic communities and offers a unique opportunity to bring the South Caucasus into the comparitive study of ancient complex polities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Discovery of a small number of individuals in the Period III necropolis at the large northern Iranian Bronze Age site of Tepe Hissar directly associated with a complex of imported artifacts raises the question of whether these individuals represent elites who had access to these exotic commodities, or an imposed foreign elite that may have brought these unusual artifacts from their homelands. The source of the atypical objects is believed to be the Oxus civilization of central Asia. This study investigates the identity of these individuals by employing canonical discriminant function analysis of 20 craniometric variables among 174 adult males from Tepe Hissar Period III and Oxus civilization males from Sapalli tepe and Djarkutan. Dicriminant function analysis provides a strong separation between Tepe Hissar Period III males and Oxus civilization males and a high level of correct assignation by sample (95.8{\%}). Imposition of the five males associated with imported central Asian artifacts from the Period III necropolis indicates that the majority (4/5) are phenetically indistinguishable from other Period III Tepe Hissar males. The results indicate that these individuals most likely represent local elite inhabitants of Tepe Hissar, rather than the presence of an imposed foreign elite. However, given the scarcity of crucial specimens, especially females, and comparative skeletal series, this conclusion must remain tentative.},

abstract = {The genesis of agriculture is one of the recurring themes of Chinese archaeology. However, while questions about the origins of domesticated plants and animals and the date of their domestication have received much recent attention, anthropologically oriented research on early sedentary communities is a less developed field. This paper contributes to such research by focusing on the structure of early sedentary communities in northeast China and addressing such issues as their economic adaptation, the internal organization of households, economic activities and sharing strategies of household members, and mechanisms of community integration. Analysis of data from the Zhaobaogou site, the only early Neolithic site from northeast China for which a comprehensive excavation report was published, suggests that households were relatively independent production and consumption units with little sharing and exchange among households. The integration of the community was probably associated with non-economic activity such as religious rituals. Comparison of the patterns observed in the Zhaobaogou data with patterns from contemporaneous sites in the Wei River area highlights differences in the social organization of the early sedentary communities in the two areas. Those differences are meaningful for our understanding of the different socio-political trajectories of the two areas and may serve for cross-cultural comparisons with other parts of the world. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A scholarly volume devoted to an understanding of contemporary nomadic and pastoral societies in the Middle East and North Africa. This volume recognizes the variable mobile quality of the ways of life of these societies which persist in accommodating the 'nation-state' of the 20th and 21st century but remain firmly transnational and highly adaptive. Composed of four sections around the theme of contestation it includes examinations of contested authority and power, space and social transformation, development and economic transformation, and cultures and engendered spaces.},

@article{Bah2006a,
abstract = {In Sahel, land and resources are used, according to the seasons, by various actors with interests sometimes difficult to conciliate. This spatial competition for the access to the natural resources induces a set of processes leading to overgrazing and conflicts for the access to water. In such a complex agro-sylvo-pastoral context, acquiring and formalizing knowledge about the practices and rules which govern the system are essential to help and accompany the rural populations towards the sustainable management of their environment. Among the new modelling tools coming from the field of Artificial Intelligence, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are now widely used to tackle the issue of integrated natural resource management. The increase in popularity of ABMs is partially due to their intelligibility, not only by scientists from various research fields, but also by stakeholders. It then becomes easier to build an understandable representation of the system as an “artificial world” and to perform simulations in order to collectively test and discuss various scenarios about the resource management. This paper describes an ABM which has been designed to formalize the interactions between the biophysics dynamics of the natural resources and the socio-economic factors driving the land-use dynamics around the drilling of Thieul village in the sylvo-pastoral area of Ferlo (Senegal). The first results show that rainfall still plays an extremely significant role in the pastoral system despite the drilling of boreholes. Paradoxically, steady rainfall over long periods of time can lead to negative effects on the relations between herders and farmers.},

@article{Haber2012,
abstract = {Afghanistan has held a strategic position throughout history. It has been inhabited since the Paleolithic and later became a crossroad for expanding civilizations and empires. Afghanistan's location, history, and diverse ethnic groups present a unique opportunity to explore how nations and ethnic groups emerged, and how major cultural evolutions and technological developments in human history have influenced modern population structures. In this study we have analyzed, for the first time, the four major ethnic groups in present-day Afghanistan: Hazara, Pashtun, Tajik, and Uzbek, using 52 binary markers and 19 short tandem repeats on the non-recombinant segment of the Y-chromosome. A total of 204 Afghan samples were investigated along with more than 8,500 samples from surrounding populations important to Afghanistan's history through migrations and conquests, including Iranians, Greeks, Indians, Middle Easterners, East Europeans, and East Asians. Our results suggest that all current Afghans largely share a heritage derived from a common unstructured ancestral population that could have emerged during the Neolithic revolution and the formation of the first farming communities. Our results also indicate that inter-Afghan differentiation started during the Bronze Age, probably driven by the formation of the first civilizations in the region. Later migrations and invasions into the region have been assimilated differentially among the ethnic groups, increasing inter-population genetic differences, and giving the Afghans a unique genetic diversity in Central Asia.},
