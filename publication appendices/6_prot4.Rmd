# Protocol 4 - Provenance data {#prot4}

The following example applies protocol 4 to confirm workshops' provenance groups.

Protocol 4 consist in: 

1. Select provenance-specific variables in **_geochemical_** compositional data (CoDa) and ordinal **_petrographic_** data;
2. **_Centred log-ratio transformation_** (clr) and transform to **_ranks_**;
3. **_Extended Gower coefficient of dissimilarity_**, using **Relative ranking difference** (RRD);
4. Apply **_Principal Coordinates Analysis_** (PCoA);
5. Perform **_PERMANOVA & PERMDISP_** tests;

Last, search for outliers and re-do protocol excluding outliers.

NOTE: The initial procedures must be ran at least once before any protocol can be applied.


## Ordination procedure

As protocol 3, protocol 4 performs PCoA on a distance matrix calculated with Extended Gower coefficient of dissimilarity, combining Euclidean distances on transformed compositional data (50%) and RRD on ranked petrographic data (50%).

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
prot4_2d <- apply_ordination(cleanAmphorae[!isShipwreck,],
                             "4", # select protocol 4
                             exception_columns = excep_cols,
                             variable_tags = varCode,
                             coda_override = chemVars16,
                             coda_transformation = "CLR")

prot4_3d <- apply_ordination(cleanAmphorae[!isShipwreck,],
                             "4", # select protocol 4
                             exception_columns = excep_cols,
                             variable_tags = varCode,
                             coda_override = chemVars16,
                             coda_transformation = "CLR",
                             dimensions = 3)
```

However, protocol 4 uses a finer selection of petrographic variables, which are considered indicative of provenance (raw materials) rather than technology. Compare the number of variables in protocol 3 and 4:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(cbind("Protocol 3" = nrow(prot3_2d$loadings),
                   "Protocol 4" = nrow(prot4_2d$loadings)))
```

## Simplify CoDa names

We may want to simplify the names of the transformed variables before plotting them in a biplot. 

```{r}
prot4_2d <- simplify_coda_names(prot4_2d)
prot4_3d <- simplify_coda_names(prot4_3d)
```

## Test the given provenance groups

With protocol 4, we can test the provenance assigned to the amphorae samples based only on provenance-specific variables.

```{r}
prot4_tests <- test_groups(prot4_2d$dist_matrix,
                           factor_list$ProvGroup)
```

These tests were explained in [protocol 1](#tests).

## Biplots

The details on how to create biplots is already explained in [protocol 1](#biplots). As protocol 3, protocol 4 only generates one kind of projection (RRD, PCoA).

### Biplot 2D

```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5, fig.cap = "protocol 4"}

                          c(0,.5),c(.5,1),c(1,.5),c(.5,1))
row.names(arrows_label_adj) <- c("CaO","S4","S7","S8","Ce",
                                 "Nb","Al2O3","S11","Fe2O3")

                       group_color = color_list$ProvGroup,
                       group_label_cex = 0.6,
                       arrow_mim_dist = .5,
                       arrow_label_cex = 0.6,
                       arrow_fig = c(.6,.95,0,.35),
                       arrow_label_adj_override = arrows_label_adj,
                       subtitle = prot4_2d$sub2D,
                       test_text = prot4_tests$text(prot4_tests),
                       test_fig = c(0, 0.5, 0.62, .99),
                       fitAnalysis_fig = c(0,.7,.05,.5),
                       output_type = c("preview"))
```
