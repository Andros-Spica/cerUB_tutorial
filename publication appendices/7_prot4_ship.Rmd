# Protocol 4 - Provenance data with shipwrecks {#prot4ship}

The following example applies protocol 4 to confirm shipwrecks samples attribution to workshops' provenance groups.

Protocol 4 consist in: 

1. Select provenance-specific variables in **_geochemical_** compositional data (CoDa) and ordinal **_petrographic_** data;
2. **_Centred log-ratio transformation_** (clr) and transform to **_ranks_**;
3. **_Extended Gower coefficient of dissimilarity_**, using **Relative ranking difference** (RRD);
4. Apply **_Principal Coordinates Analysis_** (PCoA);
5. Perform **_PERMANOVA & PERMDISP_** tests;

Last, search for outliers and re-do protocol excluding outliers.

NOTE: The initial procedures must be ran at least once before any protocol can be applied.


## Ordination procedure

As protocol 3, protocol 4 performs PCoA on a distance matrix calculated with Extended Gower coefficient of dissimilarity, combining Euclidean distances on transformed compositional data (50%) and RRD on ranked petrographic data (50%). In this case, we are not filtering out the shipwreck samples, but we do exclude the true outliers (IND, observations with no group assigned) so they don't pollute visualization.

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
prot4_Shipwreck_2d <- apply_ordination(# no true outliers
                                       cleanAmphorae[!isTrueIND,],
                                       "4", # select protocol 4
                                       exception_columns = excep_cols,
                                       variable_tags = varCode,
                                       coda_override = chemVars16,
                                       coda_transformation = "CLR")

prot4_Shipwreck_3d <- apply_ordination(# no true outliers
                                       cleanAmphorae[!isTrueIND,],
                                       "4", # select protocol 4
                                       exception_columns = excep_cols,
                                       variable_tags = varCode,
                                       coda_override = chemVars16,
                                       coda_transformation = "CLR",
                                       dimensions = 3)
```

## Simplify CoDa names

We may want to simplify the names of the transformed variables before plotting them in a biplot. 

```{r}
prot4_Shipwreck_2d <- simplify_coda_names(prot4_Shipwreck_2d)
prot4_Shipwreck_3d <- simplify_coda_names(prot4_Shipwreck_3d)
```

## Test the given provenance groups

We can test the provenance assigned to shipwrecks' amphorae samples together with those found and assigned to the workshops.

```{r}
prot4_Shipwreck_tests <- test_groups(prot4_Shipwreck_2d$dist_matrix,
                                     factor_list_Shipwreck$ProvGroup)
```

These tests were explained in [protocol 1](#tests).

## Biplots

The details on how to create biplots is already explained in [protocol 1](#biplots). Protocol 4 generates PCoA projections.
